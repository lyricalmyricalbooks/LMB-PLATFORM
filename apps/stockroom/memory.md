# Project Memory: Lyricalmyrical Inventory

This file acts as a persistent memory of the project's architecture, patterns, key decisions, and recent changes.

## 1. Project Overview & Architecture
- **Type**: Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities.
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS (Single Page App, no framework) in `index.html`, `src/main.js`, `src/features/*.js` (large screens split out of main.js) and `src/lib/*.js` (pure, unit-tested logic). Vite bundles it and generates the PWA service worker; the site is deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on every push to `main`.
- **Backend**: Firebase — Firestore (primary; per-book data in `books/{bookId}/data/{part}`, global config in `settings/{name}`), Realtime Database (legacy fallback for books whose `fs_mode_<id>` flag isn't set), Auth (Google sign-in) and Storage (receipts). The SDK is loaded from `www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/<version>/` in `src/firebase.js` and precached by the service worker so the app starts offline. Access control lives in `firestore.rules`, `database.rules.json` and `storage.rules`; these are **not** published by the Pages deploy — run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database,storage` after changing them.
- **Third-party APIs**: Canada Post, Big Cartel and outgoing email go through the publisher's deployed Google Apps Script (`apps-script/Code.gs`), which gets around browser CORS on GitHub Pages. Others (Stripe, the Gmail receipt finder, AI receipt scanning) are called straight from the browser using keys or OAuth tokens held in publisher-only settings.
- **`backend/server.js`**: a **local development helper only** — it proxies Canada Post, Zonos and campaign email sends when the app runs on localhost. Its book/author/website-settings admin endpoints and `backend/data/store.json` are not used by the app. Nothing in production depends on it.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Integrates with Google Sheets using Apps Script (`apps-script/Code.gs`).
  - **CRITICAL RULE**: Whenever `apps-script/Code.gs` is modified, it must be copied verbatim (no HTML-escaping) to `public/gas-code.txt`. The client fetches it via `loadGasCode()` when opening the "Connect your Google Sheet" tab. Vite's `syncAppsScriptPlugin` also copies it on build/dev change, but the updated file must be committed.

- **Canada Post**: Rating API 4.0.0 (REST+JSON) with mandatory OAuth 2.0 client-credentials bearer tokens; the SOAP/XML service and username:password Basic auth are retired. Standing rules live in `docs/canada-post-rating-api.md` — read it before any Canada Post change.

## 2. Key Decisions & Architectural Lessons

### Technical & Performance (from `.jules/bolt.md`)
- **Parallel Network I/O**: When importing or performing bulk operations (such as Firebase RTDB to Firestore migrations or backup restores), avoid sequential `await` inside loops. Use `Promise.all()` to execute network requests concurrently and reduce latency.
- **Unbounded Promises Caution**: Avoid wrapping large mapped arrays directly in `Promise.all()` for major operations, as browsers throttle concurrent connections (approx. 6 per origin). For very large datasets, use a concurrency limiter or chunking to avoid socket exhaustion.

### Accessibility (from `.jules/palette.md`)
- **Icon-Only Buttons**: Always ensure that buttons showing only icons (e.g., trash icons, +/-) have descriptive `aria-label` attributes (e.g., `aria-label="Delete entry"`) so screen readers can interpret them correctly.

### Role & UI/UX Guidelines (from `.agents/AGENTS.md`)
- Adhere to the **Elite UX/UI Architect** guidelines **only when necessary** (when creating, editing, or enhancing user-facing screens and components):
  - Curated HSL or Tailwind-like color systems (no raw defaults like `#ff0000`).
  - Strict theme/dark-mode adaptability.
  - Modern typography pairing (Inter/Outfit/etc. via Google Fonts) and strict font scales.
  - Generous target sizing (at least 44px x 44px for primary interactive elements).
  - Micro-transitions using custom bezier curves (e.g., `transition: all 0.25s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`).

## 3. Core Data Schemas & Models

### Book Catalog Object Schema (`BOOKS`)
Each book within the catalog is a structured object mapped by its unique ID. Key fields include:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier (e.g., `'gatsby'`).
- `title` (string): Title of the book (whitespace-trimmed).
- `author` (string): Book author.
- `isbn` (string): ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 identifier (defaults to `'—'`).
- `maxPrint` (number): Max print run capacity (default `100`).
- `listPrice` (number): Default list price (default `40`).
- `currency` (string): Currency symbol (e.g., `'€'`, `'$'`).
- `threshold` (number): Low stock trigger threshold (default `10`).
- `productionCost` (number): Manufacturing/printing cost per unit.
- `pubGratuity` (number) / `authorGratuity` (number): Percentage profit split for the publisher and author.
- `paymentLink` (string): Author-direct or default Paypal/Interac payment link.
- `stripeLink` (string): Stripe Checkout URL for book purchase.
- `acceptedMethods` (array): Configured payment channels for the book (`['stripe', 'paypal', 'interac', 'cash_card']`).
- `useGlobalMethods` (boolean): Flag indicating whether the book inherits payment options from the website level (default `true`).

### Settings Config Keys
The app stores global configurations via Firebase settings and local storage. **Read access is an allowlist**: only `modeFlags`, `notifyEndpoint`, `analyticsConfig`, `catalog`, `paymentLinks`, `productionCosts` and `websitePaymentMethods` are readable by non-publisher accounts (`isAuthorReadableSetting()` in `firestore.rules`, mirrored in `database.rules.json`); every other settings doc — including any new one — is publisher-only. `tests/security-rules.test.js` fails if a settings doc the app uses hasn't been classified.
- `paymentLinks`: Map of book ID to custom payment link.
- `websitePaymentMethods`: Array of active global website-level payment methods (`['stripe', 'paypal', 'interac', 'cash_card']`).
- `invoiceSettings`: Object containing global invoice sequences, company logos, bank transfer details, and tax defaults.

## 4. Key API & Integration Workflows

### Stripe Payment Reconciliation Flow
1. **Sync Action (`reconcileSync`)**: Pulls recent payments using the user's saved Stripe restricted key.
2. **Auto-Matching Rules**:
   - Parses payment descriptions for invoice numbers (e.g. matching `INV-` patterns).
   - Resolves SKU codes mapped to catalog entries.
   - Automatically processes matched items and displays confirmation alerts.
3. **Manual Worklist**:
   - Payments without direct matches are placed in the Reconciliation list.
   - Publishers manually select the corresponding book, adjust quantities, and record the sale (deducting stock and documenting earnings) or dismiss it.

### Big Cartel ↔ Ledger Reconciliation
- **Problem it solves**: the Gmail scan (`fetchOrders` → `applyOne`) was the only intake path for website orders. An order whose confirmation email was filtered, deleted, or older than the `daysBack` window never entered the app at all — no history row, no stock deduction, nothing for a paid shipping label to link to.
- **Comparison**: `src/lib/bigcartel-ledger-gap.js` (pure) compares `fetchAllBigCartelOrders()` output against every order number the ledger knows (`getShippingReconciliationOrders()` + scan-memory `appliedNums`). Runs automatically once after `loadAllBooks()` resolves, cached in `localStorage` for 6 hours, and on demand from the Big Cartel tab.
- **Review queue**: missing orders appear in a panel on the Big Cartel tab; each is added with one click via `commitRecoveredWebsiteOrder()` — the same ledger write path a scanned order takes. Entries carry the **real** storefront order number and the deterministic `bc-<number>` `sheetsId`, so an added order is indistinguishable downstream from a scanned one.
- **Repair**: `findRecoveredOrderConflicts()` matches legacy `#RECOV-` placeholder rows (created by the shipping worklist's older recovery flow) to their real storefront orders, offering a renumber, or a void when the sale is recorded twice.
- **Alarm**: `syncBigCartelShippingPaid` / `triggerBigCartelShippingSync` now count storefront orders with no ledger row and warn, instead of reporting "already up to date" over them.
- **Fixed while here**: both sync loops compared `normalizeShippingOrderNumber(a) === normalizeShippingOrderNumber(b)`, which returns `''` for any number without a hyphen — so two *unidentifiable* orders compared equal and one could overwrite the other's `shippingPaid`. Now guarded by `sameOrderNumber()`.
- **No Apps Script change**: the `proxybigcartel` action already exists (`Code.gs` v35), so no `scriptVersion` bump and no `gas-code.txt` copy was required.

### Google Sheets Real-Time Sync
- Implemented as a bidirectional synchronization flow.
- Writes and appends ledger orders to Google Sheets using Apps Script endpoint calls.
- Runs bulk export tasks in batches to avoid execution timeouts.

### Local-First Persistence & Sync Queue
- A change updates the in-memory book state (`states[bookId]`) and the screen immediately, then `saveState()` writes it to Firestore via `window._fbSave`.
- `_fbSave` reads the server copy first and three-way merges per part (`src/lib/merge-state.js`) if another device wrote since this one last synced, then commits all changed parts in one atomic batch.
- If the device is offline or the write can't be verified, the latest state per book goes into the offline queue (`lm-sync-queue` in localStorage, via `src/lib/sync-queue-store.js`, which never throws on full or damaged storage) and is retried with backoff; the sync chip shows what's pending.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

### PWA Caching & Service Worker Refresh
- **Issue**: Cached files are retained by browsers, causing users to see legacy features or missing components.
- **Solution**: Service Worker uses revision hashes in `vite-plugin-pwa` config. On dev deployments, trigger cache-clearing or prompt user reload.

### PowerShell Script Execution Policy (Windows)
- **Issue**: Running commands like `npm run test` or `npx vitest` on Windows PowerShell fails with `UnauthorizedAccess` due to disabled script execution.
- **Solution**: Bypass via `cmd.exe /c "npm run test"`, or temporarily bypass the execution policy:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "npm run test"
  ```

### Local API proxy (Canada Post / Zonos / campaign sends)
- **Issue**: On localhost, Canada Post rates/labels, Zonos quotes and Resend campaign sends go through `/api/*`, which Vite proxies to `backend/server.js`; without it those calls fall back to the Apps Script route.
- **Solution**: Run `npm run dev:backend` (or `npm run dev:all`) alongside the Vite dev server when working on those integrations. Book data never goes through it — that is always Firebase.

## 6. Agent Maintenance Protocol
To ensure this repository remains clean, transparent, and easy to maintain for future sessions, all developer agents must adhere to the following:
1. **Model Schema Updates**: If you add, remove, or modify properties in book objects, transaction ledgers, or global config settings, document the changes in **Section 3 (Core Data Schemas)**.
2. **Integration Updates**: Document any changes made to Stripe reconciliation, Sheets integration, or PWA caches in **Section 4 (Workflows)**.
3. **Setup Workarounds**: If you encounter Windows execution constraints, build issues, or environment mismatches, document the solution under **Section 5 (Troubleshooting)**.

## 7. Recent Work & Milestones (June 2026)
- **Payment Methods Configuration**: Enabled configuring accepted payment methods (Stripe, PayPal, Interac, Cash/Card) globally for the website and per-book. Integrated this config with invoice templates, payment QR codes (all-books, single book, author views), backend validation and local-first persistence.
- **Settings Enhancements**: Renamed settings tab to "Settings", simplified the Google Sheets connection flow, and removed obsolete cards.
- **Inline Validation**: Added an unsaved changes indicator and inline validation for the artist payment link.
- **Agent Guidelines**: Added `.agents/AGENTS.md` to define senior UX/UI design system specifications.

## 8. Active Constraints & Development Workflow
- **Vite commands**:
  - `npm run dev` to start frontend dev server.
  - `npm run dev:backend` to run local Node backend.
  - `npm run dev:all` to run both frontend and backend concurrently.
  - `npm run build` to build static frontend site.
  - `npm run lint` for ESLint checks.
  - `npm test` for Vitest tests.
