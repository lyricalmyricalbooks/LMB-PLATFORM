/* Your Press Inventory — Unified Backend (v59)
 * Features:
 *  1. Gmail scanner for Big Cartel order emails, including customer-paid shipping
 *  2. Sheets sync with:
 *     - Per-book tabs + unified "Overview" tab
 *     - Void/delete by eventId (removes the matching row); any VOID/CANCEL
 *       write is treated as a delete so voided sales never linger
 *     - 'reset' action clears managed sheets for a clean client rebuild
 *       (wipes duplicates, stale VOID rows, and blank-CAD legacy rows)
 *     - CAD-equivalent column using live FX (cached 6h)
 *     - Cleaner formatting: frozen header, banding, currency formats, hidden ID col
 *  3. Email receipt scanner & fetcher (v5 additions)
 *  4. v6: receipt search actually returns results (GmailMessage has no
 *     getSnippet(), so every thread used to fail silently) and reports
 *     skipped threads instead of hiding them
 *  5. v7: getEmailContent excludes inline images so saved receipt files
 *     are real attachments, not signature logos
 *  6. v8: 'emailauthor' action sends artist payment-request emails, plus the
 *     'notifypublisher' approval-alert path. Bump flags any deploy still on v7
 *     (which lacks these) as outdated so the publisher knows to redeploy.
 *  7. v9: artist payment-request email can be routed through a third-party
 *     transactional email provider (Resend / Brevo / SendGrid / Mailgun /
 *     Postmark) via sendMail_, so it sends from a neutral "the app" address
 *     instead of the script owner's Gmail. Configure it in Script Properties
 *     (see configureMail_). With no provider configured it falls back to
 *     MailApp unchanged. Bump flags v8-and-older deploys as outdated.
 *  8. v10: adds a trailing "Invoice" column so consignment Sale rows carry the
 *     invoice number that bills them (blank on every other row). ensureSheet_
 *     now rewrites a managed sheet's header row in place when it drifts, so the
 *     new column self-labels on the next sync. Bump flags v9-and-older as
 *     outdated so the publisher redeploys to gain the column.
 *  9. v11: Gmail-style rich text Template Designer support.
 *  10. v12: Adds threadId support to reply to existing email threads instead of starting new ones.
 *  11. v13: Open Call thread capture + intake. sendcampaignemail can now send a
 *      fresh email via GmailApp and return the new thread's id (captureThread),
 *      so stage-1 selection emails are remembered and every later stage replies
 *      into the same thread. Adds 'scanopencallsubmissions' to turn artists'
 *      original submission emails into contributors (name, email, photo
 *      filenames, and the submission thread id). Bump flags v12-and-older as
 *      outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  12. v14: scanopencallsubmissions de-dupes repeat senders by preferring the
 *      thread that actually carries photo attachments, so a stray follow-up
 *      email can't become an artist's canonical thread. Bump flags v13-and-
 *      older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  13. v15: scanopencallreplies also detects bounces — a delivery-failure
 *      notice from mailer-daemon/postmaster naming a contributor flags them
 *      undeliverable, so "bounced" is distinguishable from "no reply yet".
 *      Bump flags v14-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  14. v16: sendcampaignemail can send as a verified Gmail "send as" alias
 *      (fromAlias/fromName) for valid SPF/DKIM on a custom domain while still
 *      threading. New getmailsenderinfo action returns the available aliases
 *      and the remaining daily send quota (powers the bulk-send quota guard).
 *      Bump flags v15-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  15. v17: Open Call server-side scheduled scan. 'syncopencallsnapshot'
 *      stores a compact contributor snapshot in a hidden _OpenCallSync tab;
 *      'ocschedule' installs/removes a time-driven trigger that runs
 *      ocScheduledScan() every 30/60 min, scanning Gmail against the snapshot
 *      and appending new findings to a hidden _OpenCallFindings tab (with an
 *      optional email digest to the owner). Nothing is auto-applied: the app
 *      re-detects the same findings on its next client scan and queues them
 *      in its approval inbox. Bump flags v16-and-older as outdated so the
 *      publisher redeploys.
 *  16. v18: Bulk Sheets sync batches rows into chunked POSTs and refreshes the
 *      Overview summary once per batch instead of once per row. This removes
 *      hundreds of Apps Script round-trips during Sync all data / Repair legacy
 *      rows. Bump flags v17-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  17. v19: Big Cartel Gmail scanning captures customer-paid shipping/postage
 *      from explicit Shipping/Postage rows or named shipping methods by using
 *      Total - Subtotal - Tax. Bump flags v18-and-older as outdated so the
 *      publisher redeploys before scanning website orders.
 *  18. v20: Big Cartel proxy API request handler. Bypasses client-side CORS issues.
 *      Bump flags v19-and-older as outdated.
 *  19. v21: Import Receipts from Email was serializing one Apps Script round-trip
 *      per selected message (each paying its own cold start) and, inside
 *      listReceiptEmails_, calling GmailMessage.getMessages() once per thread —
 *      50 sequential Gmail backend fetches to build a results list. Adds
 *      'getEmailContents' (batch, up to 12 message ids per call, metadata-only
 *      attachments by default) and switches listReceiptEmails_ to the batched
 *      GmailApp.getMessagesForThreads(). The client feature-detects
 *      capabilities.batchEmailContent before using the new endpoint, so an
 *      older deployment keeps working on the one-at-a-time path. Bump flags
 *      v20-and-older as outdated.
 *  20. v22: notifyPublisher approval-alert emails now send a designed HTML
 *      version (branded header, ACTION REQUIRED banner, labeled Book/Author/
 *      Submitted fields, readable Details table instead of a raw JSON dump)
 *      alongside the existing plain-text body as a fallback.
 *  21. v23: notifyPublisher's needsAction test also matches "payout" and
 *      "reimburse" kinds, so the new artist-initiated "Payout Request" (and the
 *      existing "Reimbursement request") land as [ACTION REQUIRED] with the
 *      action banner instead of being filed as informational. Bump flags
 *      v22-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  22. v24: Canada Post Web Services and Zonos GraphQL API proxies in doPost
 *      ('proxycanadapost' and 'proxyzonos') to eliminate client-side CORS issues
 *      for live direct rates, duty-free calculations, label creation, and PDF
 *      label downloads. Bump flags v23-and-older as outdated.
 *  23. v25: 'proxycanadapost' accepts an isTracking flag and sends the
 *      'application/vnd.cpc.track+xml' Accept header, so the client's
 *      "Check Account & Tracking PIN" action can verify a purchased label
 *      really exists on Canada Post's tracking system from a static deploy.
 *  24. v26: Declare action in doPost for proxycanadapost and proxyzonos routing.
 *      Bump flags v25-and-older as outdated.
 *  25. v27: Add OAuth 2.0 token resolution for Canada Post Developer Portal Client ID/Secret.
 *      Bump flags v26-and-older as outdated.
 *  26. v28: Rebranded to Your Press Inventory with state-of-the-art graphical HTML email templates,
 *      human-readable timestamps, gold luxury masthead, and action badges. Bump flags v27-and-older as outdated.
 *  27. v29: Luxury graphical HTML email template for author payment requests (emailauthor action).
 *      Bump flags v28-and-older as outdated.
 *  28. v30: Detailed OAuth 2.0 error reporting and HTTP Basic header fallback for Canada Post API subscriptions.
 *      Bump flags v29-and-older as outdated.
 *  29. v31: Fixes 'proxycanadapost' authentication, which had been failing for
 *      every Canada Post Web Services request. v27-v30 guessed the auth scheme
 *      from the shape of the API key: a 32-character hex key was assumed to be
 *      a Developer Portal OAuth client ID and sent to the OAuth token endpoint.
 *      Developer Program API usernames are hex too, so valid Web Services
 *      credentials were routed into a token exchange that cannot succeed, and
 *      the proxy then aborted with an "invalid client ID or secret" error
 *      WITHOUT EVER CALLING CANADA POST. The scheme is now chosen from the
 *      endpoint host — soa-gw.canadapost.ca and ct.soa-gw.canadapost.ca use
 *      HTTP Basic, api.canadapost-postescanada.ca uses OAuth — and a failed
 *      token exchange falls back to Basic instead of aborting, so Canada Post's
 *      own status code always reaches the client. Responses now also carry
 *      authMode and oauthNote for diagnostics. Bump flags v30-and-older as
 *      outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  30. v32: Transitioned Canada Post API from legacy XML and Basic Auth to the
 *      modern JSON/OAuth 2.0 Developer Portal API. 'proxycanadapost' now uses
 *      JSON payloads and 'application/vnd.cpc...json' headers instead of XML.
 *      Bump flags v31-and-older as outdated.
 *  31. v33: Cache OAuth 2.0 token in CacheService for 55m to avoid rate limits.
 *      Bump flags v32-and-older as outdated.
 *  32. v34: Fix 406 Not Acceptable errors by sending 'application/json' headers
 *      to Canada Post Developer Portal instead of legacy vnd.cpc custom types.
 *  33. v35: Migrate Tracking and Label Artifact proxy to Canada Post's new
 *      JSON/OAuth architecture. Bump flags v34-and-older as outdated.
 *  34. v36: Fixes Canada Post OAuth 2.0 token acquisition and updates tracking endpoint.
 *  35. v37: Restores mandatory scope=merchant for Canada Post Developer Portal OAuth 2.0 token acquisition. Bump flags v36-and-older as outdated.
 *  36. v38: Sends the Canada Post client credentials as the documented X-IBM-Client-Id / X-IBM-Client-Secret headers on the OAuth token exchange.
 *  37. v39: Canada Post Developer Portal Shipping v1, strict JSON media types, and label refund/void proxy support. Enables requesting postage refunds and cancellations via the Developer Portal refund endpoint. Bump flags v38-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  38. v40: Canada Post Developer Portal Shipping v1 Non-Delivery Handling options (RTS/RASE), customs skuList array payload format, and HS tariff dotted regex formatting. Bump flags v39-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  39. v41: Sheet rows are kept in date order. Every write path ended in an
 *      append, so the sheet was ordered by when a row was delivered rather
 *      than when the sale happened — a backdated fair sale, a catch-up Gmail
 *      scan, or a full repair pass all landed at the bottom, putting July
 *      under September. That also broke the app's restore path, which states
 *      it is handed rows "in chronological order" and rebuilds each book's
 *      running stock balance on that basis. sortManagedSheets_ now re-sorts
 *      every tab a write touched (Overview included) by Date ascending, with a
 *      stable tiebreak so an order and its postage row stay adjacent, and rows
 *      with an unusable date sort last instead of to the top. Batch and
 *      single-row deletes also collapse consecutive rows into deleteRows()
 *      runs rather than one deleteRow() round-trip each, which is a large part
 *      of why a bulk sync could run long enough for the client to give up on
 *      it mid-write. Responses add sorted:true. Bump flags v40-and-older as
 *      outdated so the publisher redeploys to get ordered rows.
 *  40. v42: doPost could not write a single row. Its batch branch, its reset
 *      branch and its closing single-row upsert all read `ss`, but nothing in
 *      doPost ever declared it — the spreadsheet handle was only ever fetched
 *      inside doGet and the reporting helpers. Every write therefore threw
 *      `ReferenceError: ss is not defined`, doPost's own catch turned that into
 *      a tidy `{ error: ... }` with a 200 status, and the client — which
 *      treated any thrown error as a transport problem — re-POSTed the payload
 *      blind with mode:'no-cors' and logged the row as written. Nothing reached
 *      the sheet and the sync log claimed everything had. doPost now takes the
 *      handle once, ahead of the three write branches (and after the proxy and
 *      email branches, which never touch the spreadsheet), and answers with a
 *      readable message when the script is not bound to a spreadsheet at all.
 *      Bump flags v41-and-older as outdated: on those deployments no sheet
 *      write can succeed.
 *  41. v43: sendcampaignemail can carry one file attachment (`attachments`:
 *      [{filename, mimeType, base64}]), delivered via GmailApp/MailApp or the
 *      configured third-party provider (Resend, Brevo, SendGrid, Mailgun,
 *      Postmark — each in its own attachment shape). Powers the invoice PDF
 *      now attached to payment reminder emails, in place of the pay button
 *      that used to be in the email body. Bump flags v42-and-older as
 *      outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  42. v44: 'extractreceipt' reads invoices, receipts and bills out of a single
 *      scanned email, folding the standalone Receipt Finder deployment into
 *      this one script so there is a single deployment address to maintain and
 *      redeploy. Needs one new Script Property, GEMINI_API_KEY; the optional
 *      FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY + PUBLISHER_UID pair adds a publisher check when
 *      both are present. doGet now reports a `receiptAi` block (which settings
 *      exist, never their values) so the app can name a missing key before a
 *      scan spends Gmail requests and paid AI calls. Bump flags v43-and-older
 *      as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  43. v45: 'testreceiptai' makes one tiny Gemini call and reports the status
 *      it came back with, so the app can tell a key Google actually accepts
 *      from one that merely exists. v44's setup check only proved the Script
 *      Property was filled in, and reported Ready for a rejected key — the
 *      publisher then met the failure one email at a time, worded as a passing
 *      outage. Only the status is returned, never the upstream body. Bump
 *      flags v44-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  44. v46: 'receiptDailyScan' reads yesterday's mail for receipts on a daily
 *      time-driven trigger and writes what it finds to the app's Firestore
 *      inbox, where the existing review screen already picks it up. The browser
 *      could never do this — it needs the app open and a Gmail token good for
 *      an hour — so a scheduled scan has to live in the publisher's own
 *      account. Deliberately one day at a time, capped at 20 messages: a narrow
 *      window is what keeps this inside Gemini's free allowance, and a wide one
 *      is what exhausts it. 'receiptdailyschedule' installs, removes and reports
 *      the trigger; a run that meets a spent allowance stops and leaves its
 *      watermark, so the rest of the window is read next time rather than
 *      skipped. Bump flags v45-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  45. v47: receipt reading falls back to OpenRouter when Gemini cannot answer —
 *      a spent daily allowance, depleted credit, a refused key or an outage.
 *      The daily sweep uses the OpenRouter key the publisher already saved in
 *      the app's Tax Centre settings (read from Firestore with the owner's own
 *      token, like the inbox writes), or an OPENROUTER_API_KEY Script Property
 *      when one is set; 'extractreceipt' uses the Script Property only, because
 *      anyone holding the deployment address can call it. Once Gemini refuses
 *      in a run, the rest of that run goes straight to the backup. The daily
 *      status says how many emails the backup read. Adds the receiptBackupAi
 *      capability. Bump flags v46-and-older as outdated so the publisher
 *      redeploys.
 *  46. v48: the receipt reader no longer turns away paid software, AI and
 *      subscription receipts (an Anthropic/Claude receipt was read as a
 *      "software development notification" and dropped). Only developer
 *      notifications that merely mention invoices are rejected now. Bump flags
 *      v47-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  49. v51: Complete the Chit Chats proxy with allowlisted shipment operations,
 *      staging support, official PDF artifacts, and upstream error reporting.
 *  50. v52: the Chit Chats relay also accepts DELETE on a single shipment, so
 *      the app can remove the unpaid rate-quote draft a changed parcel
 *      replaced (Chit Chats itself refuses to delete anything with postage).
 *      Bump flags v51-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  51. v53: the webhook now authenticates callers. Every action except the
 *      plain health/capabilities GET requires a Firebase ID token (GET:
 *      ?idToken=, POST: top-level idToken) that Firebase itself verifies, and
 *      the verified, email_verified address must be the publisher's. The one
 *      exception is 'notifypublisher' (an author's submission alert), which
 *      accepts any verified signed-in user and stamps their own address on the
 *      email. Before this, anyone holding the URL (it is readable from the
 *      app's settings) could search the publisher's Gmail, send mail as them,
 *      or reset the sheet. Also: bulk sync grows the sheet grid before
 *      appending (it failed near 1000 rows), writes take a script lock so a
 *      client retry cannot overlap a still-running write, the daily receipt
 *      sweep no longer moves its watermark past mail it did not read or save,
 *      and Open Call reply detection only counts mail sent after the request.
 *      Bump flags v52-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  52. v54: the Gmail order scan reads the item quantity from the Big Cartel
 *      receipt ("Quantity 3", "Qty: 3", "x 3", "3 x") and sends it as qty with
 *      a per-copy price. Before this every order came through as one copy at
 *      the whole merchandise total, so a 3-copy order took 1 off stock. With no
 *      quantity on the receipt it still reports 1. Bump flags v53-and-older as
 *      outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  53. v55: Open Call reply detection also recognises an artist who answers
 *      in a brand-new email thread. v53 only counted a reply that followed one
 *      of our messages inside the same thread, so a fresh email with the credit
 *      name or the high-res files was missed. It now also counts mail from the
 *      artist in other threads dated after our first email to them (found in
 *      Sent), which still leaves out their original submission, sent before
 *      any outreach. With no sent email to the artist it counts nothing. Bump
 *      flags v54-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  47. v49: the "Monthly (CAD)" tab rebuilds itself on every sync instead of
 *      only from the menu, so it no longer goes stale (it was missing months
 *      and whole books). It leaves out test/connection-check rows, adds a
 *      Shipping column so its grand total matches Revenue on __Summary, fills
 *      in empty months, and writes live SUM formulas for its totals. Test rows
 *      are also left out of the Key numbers panel, which now splits Revenue
 *      into book sales and customer-paid shipping and counts only real sales
 *      plus shipping, matching the monthly tab. Bump flags v48-and-older as
 *      outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  54. v56: Sheet sync repairs. (a) Clearing a tab that had grown past its
 *      first 1000 rows failed with "not possible to delete all non-frozen
 *      rows" — the grid fits the data exactly by then — so "Repair legacy
 *      rows" never got past its first step; a spare row is now added first.
 *      (b) A bulk batch is applied as if its rows arrived one at a time: the
 *      last row for an id wins, so one record sent twice is one row, and an
 *      add followed by a delete leaves nothing behind. (c) New 'prune' action:
 *      after "Sync all data" the app lists the books it is sure of and every
 *      id it holds for them, and rows of those books it no longer has are
 *      removed (hand-typed rows without an id, other books and connection
 *      checks are left alone). (d) Expense and artist-payout rows (types
 *      'expense' and 'payout') are reported as Expenses / Paid to artists in
 *      Key numbers, and the currency table on __Summary now sums income rows
 *      only, so money going out is never added to revenue. (e) Overview no
 *      longer takes the colour of the last book written, and tabs created by
 *      a bulk sync get their book's colour. Bump flags v55-and-older as
 *      outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  55. v57: (a) 'prune' also removes a row without an id that is an exact
 *      copy of a row the app owns in the same tab — the duplicates earlier
 *      "Sync all data" presses left behind — so the next sync cleans them up
 *      without a full rebuild; hand-typed rows that match nothing stay.
 *      (b) New 'renamebook' action: the old tab takes the new title (or its
 *      rows join an existing tab of that name) and every row's Book cell is
 *      relabelled. (c) Writes are faster: __Summary is laid out once and later
 *      writes only update Key numbers, Monthly (CAD) is only reformatted when
 *      its months or books change, Overview is read once per refresh, and a
 *      write sent with deferSummary:true (more queued behind it) skips the
 *      refresh entirely. Bump flags v56-and-older as outdated so the
 *      publisher redeploys.
 *  56. v58: the platform copy (LMB-PLATFORM apps/stockroom) names no press:
 *      owner and sender addresses, links and the shop name are neutral
 *      placeholders until each press's own settings replace them. Bump flags
 *      v57-and-older as outdated so the publisher redeploys.
 *  57. v59: the last of one press's name leaves the script: the web lookup
 *      introduces itself as StockroomProxy and the AI helper's requests are
 *      titled "Stockroom". Bump flags v58-and-older as outdated so the
 *      publisher redeploys.

// Outbound email — provider-agnostic sender
//
// By default email goes out through MailApp, which Google forces to send from
// the account that owns this script (e.g. owner@example.com). To
// make payment-request emails come from a neutral "the app" address instead,
// configure a transactional email provider in this script's Script Properties
// (Project Settings ▸ Script Properties, or run configureMail_ once):
//
//   MAIL_PROVIDER   resend | brevo | sendgrid | mailgun | postmark
//   MAIL_API_KEY    the provider API key / server token
//   MAIL_FROM       a verified sender address, e.g. noreply@example.com
//   MAIL_FROM_NAME  display name shown to recipients (optional, default below)
//   MAIL_REPLY_TO   where replies should go (optional; leave unset to keep the
//                   publisher's personal address hidden)
//   MAIL_DOMAIN     Mailgun sending domain        (Mailgun only)
//   MAIL_REGION     "eu" for Mailgun's EU region  (Mailgun only, optional)
//
// The API key lives in Script Properties on Google's servers — never in the
// repo or client code — so the static-hosting / no-client-secrets rule holds.
// If MAIL_PROVIDER (or the key / from address) is unset, this falls back to
// MailApp unchanged, so deployments keep working until a provider is set up.
