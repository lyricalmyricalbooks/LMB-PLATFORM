# UX Component Patterns — reuse before inventing

## Buttons — `.btn`
Base: `.btn` (`style.css:2502`) — Archivo 800 uppercase at `--text-xs` (11px) with `--tracking-caps`, square (`border-radius:var(--r2)` = 0), a 2px `--rule-ink` outline, `padding:8px 16px` and a flat `--elev-1` offset that grows to `--elev-hover` on hover. It sits at ~33px tall by design (a settled decision — no `min-height`); a control pressed on a phone gets its full 44px target from `.sys-target` or `btn lg`.

Modifiers (compose, don't reinvent):
- `.btn.gold` — primary action (gold fill, ink text)
- `.btn.ink` — secondary dark action
- `.btn.danger-btn` — destructive (delete, void, remove)
- `.btn.sm` — compact, for inline row actions (`padding:5px 11px`)
- `.btn.lg` — 44px-tall hero CTA
- `:disabled` is already styled (`opacity:.35`) — never build a custom disabled look.

```html
<button class="btn gold">+ Add store</button>
<button class="btn sm ink" data-action="books.manage" data-book="${escapeHtml(book.id)}">Manage →</button>
<button class="btn danger-btn sm" data-action="ledger.void" data-id="${escapeHtml(id)}">Void</button>
```

**Wiring a button: name an action, don't write code into the markup.** New buttons use
`data-action="screen.verb"` (or `data-on-change` / `data-on-input` for fields) with the
values in `data-*` attributes, and the screen registers its handlers with `registerActions`
from `src/lib/actions.js` (see `intelActions` in `features/intel.js`). Don't add new
`onclick="fn('${value}')"` attributes: a value pasted into one is a quote away from running as
script, even when escaped for HTML. `tests/actions.test.js` stops the count of inline
handlers from growing.

Row-level icon actions (edit/manage buttons that appear on hover) use `.edit-btn` —
see `.tbl tbody tr:hover .edit-btn` (`style.css:1821`) for the reveal-on-hover convention.

**Icon-only round buttons — full state set.** `.modal-close-btn` (`style.css:2741`, `:hover`/
`:active`/`:focus-visible` at `style.css:4008-4010`) is the reference: hover swaps the fill to
`--surface-inset` and lifts the icon colour to `--content-primary`, `:active` snaps a
`transform:scale(0.94)` with no transition (so it reads as an instant press, not a wobble, and
needs no `prefers-reduced-motion` guard), and `:focus-visible` gets its own outline rather than
inheriting the browser default. Any new icon-only circular button (`.more-sheet-close`,
`.store-balance-pop-close`, `.fk-pop-close`) should carry all three — a phone's bottom nav
(`.mnav-btn`) and its More-sheet tiles (`.more-sheet-body .snav`) shipped with a `background-color`
transition already declared but nothing ever set it, so every tap landed with zero visual
confirmation until the same three states were added there too.

## Status & count badges — `.pill`

### A smaller sibling family — `.chip-status`
`.chip-status` (`style.css:315`) is the compact inline badge used for
meta-annotations riding next to a piece of content (an invoice number, a
history row's channel) rather than standing alone as a status column —
`.emerald` `.amber` `.violet` `.gray` `.red` `.gold`. Two rules worth keeping:
- **Every tone the code reaches for needs a rule, or it's invisible.** The
  `.red` tone was used in `main.js` (a failed reminder chip on the Invoices
  list) for a long time with no matching CSS rule at all — it rendered with
  none of its siblings' background, border or color, so a real payment-chasing
  failure looked identical to plain text. Add a tone here the moment code
  reaches for `.chip-status.<new-color>`; don't assume an existing sibling
  class covers it.
- **Reach for `.chip-status.sm` instead of an inline `font-size` override**
  when a chip needs to sit smaller alongside other text — a run of chips each
  hand-picking its own `style="font-size:9px"` (or, worse, opting out of
  `.chip-status` entirely for a fully bespoke pill) is how one invoice row
  ended up with three different badge shapes side by side. `.sm` keeps the
  same shape at a smaller size so a row of chips still reads as one family.

Base: `.pill` (`style.css:1569`) — full-pill radius, 11px, always paired with a semantic color modifier: `.green` `.amber` `.red` `.gray` `.blue` `.gold`.

Convention: **amber = active/needs-attention, green = settled/good, gray = neutral/inert,
red = error/void, gold = highlighted/primary count.** Keep a leading glyph (`●` active, `✓`
settled, `✕` void) — it's how users scan a whole column of pills without reading text.

```html
<span class="pill amber">● Active</span>
<span class="pill gray">✓ Settled</span>
<span class="pill gold">10 accounts</span>
```

Chip variant for inline counts/filters (not status): `.pile-chip` (`style.css:1632`) —
bordered, neutral background, optional colored `.dot`.

### Flagging one tile inside a group of tiles

When one figure in a row of KPI tiles is the one to act on (Owed on a store card, a
disputed balance, a failed sync), mark it with an **inset accent bar plus a tinted
border** — `box-shadow: inset 3px 0 0 var(--status-active)` — not with a
`--status-*-bg` fill. Two reasons, both learned on `.sk` (the store card's tiles):

- **A status wash is *lighter* than the plate it sits on.** The `--status-*-bg` tokens
  are low-alpha tints designed for white cards; over `--surface-inset` in light mode
  they land paler than the neutral tiles beside them, so the flagged tile becomes the
  *least* prominent one on the card. Exactly backwards.
- **It costs the figure its contrast.** Amber `--status-active` on an amber-washed
  plate measured 4.25:1 — under AA for an 18px figure. The accent bar changes no
  background, so the figure keeps the full contrast it was checked at.

The bar is already the house device for this: `.sys-failed`/`.sys-conflict`
(`system.css`), the active consignment row, and `.store-balance-tbl tr.is-off` all use
it. Derive the state with `:has()` where the figure already carries a class
(`.sk:has(.sk-v.warn)`) rather than stamping a second class from JS — §3. Order the
rules so critical comes *after* active, or a tile that is both owed-money and
off-ledger paints amber.

### An odd number of tiles — let the lead one span, never leave an orphan

`repeat(auto-fit, minmax(…))` wraps three tiles into a row of two and a lone third with a
hole beside it — the carrier tiles on Shipping did exactly that in the desktop column. When a
group has a known, small number of tiles and one of them leads, lay it out by the group's own
width with a named container query: one column when narrow, the lead tile spanning
(`grid-column: 1 / -1`) over the rest side by side, then all in one row once there is room.
`.ship-carrier-grid` is the specimen; `tests/ship-carrier-tile-layout.test.js` pins it.

### A row that needs you is flagged, never faded

Opacity is how this app says *spent* — `.tbl tbody tr.voided td{opacity:.35}`. A row
awaiting the publisher's decision (an artist-submitted sale or expense) used to be set to
`opacity:0.8` inline, so the one row on the screen that needed action read as half-voided,
and its Approve button was dimmed with it. It now carries `.is-awaiting`: full ink, the
`--amber-bg` wash, and the inset amber bar on its first cell (the same device as above). On a
phone the bar moves up to the record card itself (`styles/phone.css`). Its Approve / Reject
pair (`.appr-btn`) sits on the `.btn` chassis — 2px ink outline, caps, `--elev-1`, press-in —
so never restyle it with a darker raw hex on hover; the lift is the hover.

### Reporting stock on a surface that spends it

Any screen that moves inventory (POS register, manual entry, a future shipment form) should say
what it is about to do to on-hand *before* it does it. Two pure helpers already encode this —
`orderStockPreview()`/`orderStockPreviewCopy()` in [src/lib/inventory.js](../src/lib/inventory.js)
for the manual-entry form, and `posStockView()`/`posOversellSummary()` in
[src/lib/pos-stock.js](../src/lib/pos-stock.js) for the register. Four rules they share:

- **Report, never recompute.** These helpers read a stock figure and describe it. The ledger keeps
  sole ownership of the number — no rounding, re-tallying, or writing back.
- **A book's `threshold` is a REORDER alarm, not a screen-level one.** It is sized against a whole
  print run (15, 30…), so on a register card it would paint nearly every title amber and mean
  nothing. Pick a cutoff that matches the surface's question; `POS_LOW_STOCK_AT` is the fair-table
  one.
- **Warn, don't block.** A seller may genuinely have brought copies the records don't know about,
  and a refused sale at a fair table is worse than an off-by-two stock count. Say what will happen
  ("on-hand stops at 0 and your count stops matching") and let them decide.
- **Never print a negative count.** Keep the true arithmetic in the returned object so the shortfall
  is reportable, and show `Math.max(0, …)` — a stock count below zero is the bug being reported, not
  a number to render.

Untracked things say nothing at all. A POS-only guest title has no catalog stock, so its card gets
no pill — a `0` there would read as "out of stock" and stop a perfectly good sale.

## Review a queue one item at a time — `.ri-*` (review inbox)

For anything the app found by itself and stopped short of deciding (a receipt read from an
email, a label bought elsewhere), don't send the owner to a table. Use the review inbox
(`src/features/review-inbox.js`, `src/styles/review-inbox.css`): a list on the left, a detail
pane on the right, and on a phone the two take turns with a "← Back to the list" button.

The pane always answers four questions in this order, in plain words:
1. **Why it is here** — the specific reason the app stopped (`reasons` from `lib/review-queue.js`).
2. **What to do** — numbered steps that name the buttons exactly as they are labelled.
3. **The details to check** — the fields, or the one decision, right there in the pane.
4. **What the app found** — the evidence (sender, subject, tracking) and a link to the original.

Rules worth keeping:
- **State is a word plus a glyph, never colour alone** — `! Needs you`, `● Take a look`, `✓ Ready to file` (`.ri-chip`).
- **Filters are squared Riso tabs, not lozenges** (`.ri-filter`): 2px ink outline, caps label like `.btn`, and the active one inked in (`--surface-inverse` / `--content-on-inverse`; night mode steps it to `--cream4` instead). The detail pane is the card on this screen — ink outline, `--elev-2` — and its title is Anton uppercase so the item leads. Lozenge radius stays reserved for the status chips. `tests/review-inbox-riso-chrome.test.js` pins it.
- **Nothing is filed by opening the screen.** A button that says "File" files; one that only opens something says "Review".
- **Disable a button only with the reason beside it** ("Fill in the missing details above to file it.").
- **Fields that save as they change go inside `[data-autosave]`**, so closing the window never asks "discard unsaved changes?" about them (see `_modalFieldSig` in `lib/modal.js`).
- **After a field edit, repaint the list and the guidance but not the box being typed in.**
- A notification that points at review work is rebuilt from what is waiting *now* (`reviewTaskStillOpen`): finished work says "All reviewed", open work says how many are left.

## Stat cards / HUD strips — one anatomy, two surfaces

A row of headline figures at the head of a screen (the consignment summary HUD, Order History's
reconciliation strip) uses **one** card anatomy. Before adding a third, extend one of these rather
than starting a parallel set — the two above were parallel systems for a while and the drift was
visible on screen.

The anatomy: **icon plate → content column → 3px bottom accent.**

```html
<div class="hist-kpi-card highlight-gold is-lead">
  <div class="hist-kpi-icon" aria-hidden="true">📚</div>
  <div class="hist-kpi-content">
    <div class="hist-kpi-label">Stock On Hand</div>
    <div class="hist-kpi-val">88</div>
    <div class="hist-kpi-sub">35% available</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Reference implementations: `.consignment-stat-card` (`style.css:4041`) and `.hist-kpi-card`
(`style.css:~110`). Five rules they share:

- **Label `--text-2xs` / 800 / `--tracking-label`, figure `'DM Mono'` at `--text-xl`, sub-line
  `--text-sm`.** Anything else and the strip reads as a different app's component. Spacing comes
  off `--space-*`; gaps written as raw 12/14/4/2px are how the drift started.
- **The accent is a 3px `::after` along the bottom, never a left border.** Everything is
  `border-box`, so a left border shrinks the content box of the accented cards only — their labels
  then sit a few px right of the unaccented card's and the row reads ragged for a reason nobody can
  name. Colour the `::after`, not the frame.
- **Exactly one card leads, by size *and* colour.** `.is-lead` steps the figure to `--text-2xl` and
  recolours it `--gold-text`. One size step on its own reads as an accident. Pick the figure the
  screen exists to act on — not the biggest number, and never more than one.
- **Sub-lines bottom-align with `margin-top:auto`.** The lead's taller figure otherwise pushes its
  own sub-line below the others'. Card is `align-items:stretch`, content is a flex column, icon
  plate takes `align-self:flex-start`.
- **The grid is an explicit `repeat(3, minmax(0,1fr))` with a `@container` step to `1fr` at 680px** —
  matching the consignment HUD, so a phone gets the same layout in both places. `auto-fit` looks
  equivalent and isn't: at mid widths it wraps 3 cards into 2 columns and leaves the third an orphan
  half the row wide. The `container-type` has to sit on a **wrapper** (`.hist-recon-strip`), because
  an element cannot query its own container.

**Progress bar under a strip:** trough is `var(--track-bg)` — never `--cream2`, which lands ~3% off
the page colour on dark and leaves the unfilled remainder invisible. The fill stays inside **one**
colour family and matches the card it plots; a `--gold` → `--emerald` ramp blends two semantic roles
across a single measurement, so the colour change reads as a state change that isn't there. Width
transitions use `var(--dur-base) var(--ease-entrance)` so they collapse under reduced motion.

**Third reference implementation — `.ps-stat-card`** (the book dashboard's Profit Sharing panel:
earnings / paid / held / owed). Same anatomy, one addition worth reusing: the row mixes cards that
just carry a coloured *figure* (`.ps-stat-val.is-positive`/`.is-muted` — earnings, paid) with cards
that are a genuine call-out (`.ps-stat-card.tone-gold`/`.tone-critical`/`.tone-green` — held, owed),
which tint the card's background, border and bottom accent together. Reach for a `tone-*` card
modifier only for the figure that actually needs the call-out; a plain `.ps-stat-val` colour is
enough for a card that's merely reporting, or every card ends up looking flagged and none of them
are. **Never reuse `.hs-label`/`.hs-val`** for a card like this — that pair is built for the app
header's permanently-dark strip (`rgba(255,255,255,.34)` label, fixed `--gold3` figure) and using it
on a light card means fighting every property back with an inline override, one per card.

**Two-sided balance — `.ps-settle`** (the Profit Sharing panel's "Settle up", `src/lib/settle-up-view.js`).
When money runs both ways between two parties, never show it as a running list that subtracts,
subtotals and subtracts again. Use two facing `.ps-settle-col` columns, one per direction. Every line
is a plain positive amount, and each column ends in one `.ps-settle-total` above a 2px ink rule (the
Riso "sum line"). The subtraction happens once, in a `.ps-stat-card.tone-*` result card whose sub-line
shows the equation (`499.97 − 267.76`). The headline strip then leads with that single net figure
instead of flagging both sides. Columns stack below 680px through a `@container` on `.ps-settle`.
Follow-up actions are a numbered `.ps-settle-steps` list (check → share → record), and the record step
only renders for a role that can write.

## Permanently-dark banner tables — `.metric-banner-table`

The dashboard's "Expenses owed to artist" banner (`.metric-banner-danger`, a fixed dark card that
does not flip with the theme — same family as `.hs-label`/`.hs-val`) used to build its table's
row markup entirely from inline styles in `main.js`: date and amount cells were flush-padded to
the banner edge while the middle three columns carried `padding:6px 8px`, there was no `<thead>`,
and the category tag was a one-off inline-styled span duplicating `.pill`/`.chip-status`. Four
rules now hold it together:
- **A static `<thead>` lives in the markup, not the renderer.** The column set doesn't change per
  render, so the header row is plain HTML in `index.html`; only `<tbody>` is re-rendered.
- **One padding rule for every cell, with edge alignment as an override, not a per-cell guess.**
  `.metric-banner-table tbody td{padding:7px 8px}` is the rule; `:first-child`/`:last-child`
  zero out the side that touches the banner's own edge. Never hand-pick a cell's padding in JS.
- **A row divider and hover, like every other list in the app.** `border-top` on `tbody tr` (not
  `border-bottom`, so the last row doesn't carry a trailing hairline) plus a hover tint — this
  table had neither, so several rows of expenses ran together into one dark block.
- **`.metric-banner-cat` is `.chip-status`'s sibling for this surface.** `.chip-status`'s tones are
  tuned against `--surface-card`; reusing it directly on a fixed `var(--ink)` fill would fight the
  same low-alpha-on-dark problem the flagged-tile accent-bar rule above exists to avoid. Match the
  banner's own established tone family (`rgba(255,255,255,.08)` fill, `--on-inverse-3` text —
  already used for this banner's other muted text) instead of pulling in a themed component that
  wasn't designed for a permanently-dark plate.

The sibling author-facing banners (`#arb-items` in `renderArtistReimburseBanner`, `#apb-transfers`
in the publisher-owed transfer summary) show the same kind of data as a flex list of rows rather
than a `<table>`, so this fix didn't originally reach them — now fixed with the equivalent row
convention: `.metric-banner-items .mbi-row` (divider + padding, no more relying on the parent's
flex `gap`), `.mbi-desc`/`.mbi-amt` for the two cells, and the amount's colour keyed off the
banner's own tone class (`.metric-banner-green .mbi-amt` / `.metric-banner-gold .mbi-amt`) rather
than a value hardcoded per call site. Reuse `.metric-banner-cat` for any tag inside one of these
rows — it's the same tone family as `.mbi-desc`, not `.chip-status`.

---

## Tables / lists — `.tbl`
Base: `.tbl` (`style.css:1540`) — dark header (`.tbl thead{background:var(--ink)}`), uppercase
9px th labels at `.14em` tracking, 13px body, right-aligned numeric columns via `th.r`/`td.r`
(and `td.r` gets `font-family:'DM Mono',monospace` — numbers are always mono in this app).

Row states to reuse rather than re-derive:
- `tbody tr:hover td` → `background:var(--cream2)` (built into `.tbl` itself)
- `.voided` → struck-through + faded (`style.css:1818`)
- Zebra + accent-bar + grouped/nested rows: see `.all-consignment-table` block
  (`style.css:2627-2662`) for the fullest example — nth-child zebra, `is-active`/`is-settled`
  row classes, a `box-shadow: inset 3px 0 0 var(--gold2)` left-accent for the active state,
  collapsible `.con-group-row` headers with a `.con-group-chevron`, and `.con-nested-row` for
  indented children. Copy this pattern for any other "grouped ledger" table before inventing
  a new grouping mechanism.
- Clickable data-viz cell inside a row (e.g. a mini progress bar that navigates): give it
  `role="button" tabindex="0"`, an `onclick` **and** an `onkeydown` handler for Enter/Space,
  and a `title` describing the destination — see `.con-row-progress-link` (`style.css:2660`)
  and `conAccountRowHtml()` in `main.js` for the reference implementation.

**Narrowing a long ledger:** the consignment ledger's filter bar (`.ledger-filter-bar`,
`renderLedgerFilterBar()` in `main.js`, pure helpers in
[src/lib/consignment-ledger-filter.js](../src/lib/consignment-ledger-filter.js)) is the
reference. Four rules it encodes, worth keeping on any other filtered money table:
- **Filter the rows the totals are taken over, never re-tally them.** The footer still calls
  `consignmentLedgerTotals()`; the filter only decides which entries it is handed, so a
  per-store total is the same arithmetic over a smaller set and adds back up to the whole.
- **Skip rows inside the original index walk** rather than mapping a filtered copy — row
  actions like `openEditLedger(i)` are keyed on the real array index.
- **Say what is hidden, not just what is shown.** An empty filtered table must state that the
  other rows exist and the filter is hiding them, or it reads as "this book has no history".
- **A live region has to be a permanent node.** `#con-ledger-status` sits outside the part of
  the bar that is rebuilt, because a region replaced wholesale announces nothing.

**Searching a long ledger:** Order History's box (`.ledger-filter-bar` + `.ledger-filter-input`,
`renderHistSearchBar()` in `main.js`, pure helpers in
[src/lib/order-history-search.js](../src/lib/order-history-search.js)) is the reference for free-text
search. It shares the filter bar's furniture — reuse `.ledger-filter-input` rather than styling a new
`<input type="search">`. Five rules on top of the filter-bar ones above:
- **The field is permanent markup, never part of the render.** A field rebuilt by `innerHTML` on
  every keystroke drops the caret mid-word. Only write `input.value` when it *disagrees* with state,
  so a render triggered while someone is typing can't reset them.
- **Debounce at 200ms**, matching `tcLedgerSearchInput()`. Repainting a fifty-row table between two
  keystrokes is wasted work.
- **Search what is on screen, not what is stored.** Rows hold `POS` but the table paints
  "In Person"; a search that only matches the stored value looks broken to anyone who has not seen
  the raw records. `channelSearchWords()` carries the alias list — keep it in step with
  `formatChannelBadge()`.
- **Text only — no dates, no amounts.** Someone typing `12` wants order 12, and folding dates in
  buries it under every order placed on the 12th of any month.
- **Scope the query to the book it was typed on.** A query carried across a book switch opens the
  next book on a table that looks empty for no visible reason.

**Totalling a money table:** `.ledger-total-row` + `.ledger-total-label` / `.ledger-total-sub` /
`.ledger-total-val` (`.is-owed` amber, `.is-clear` green, `.is-neutral`) / `.ledger-total-scope`
is the shared footer furniture. `.is-end` on the label right-aligns it when it spans several
columns before its figure. Three rules every footer here follows:
- **One row per currency, never one sum across them.** Bucket by the code each row was recorded
  in (`consignmentLedgerTotals()` in [src/lib/consignment.js](../src/lib/consignment.js),
  `expenseLedgerTotals()` in [src/lib/expense-totals.js](../src/lib/expense-totals.js) — same
  shape, book's own code first then alphabetical, so the order is stable across re-renders). Add
  a `<span class="chip-status gray">CODE</span>` only once there is more than one bucket.
- **Never convert at render time.** An exchange rate belongs to the day the money moved; a rate
  invented in the footer disagrees with the per-row converted column beside it.
- **Say all-clear outright.** A bare `0.00` does not read as "nobody is waiting to be paid" —
  swap the label ("All settled", "All reimbursed") and the pill, and keep a sub-line naming what
  *has* been settled.

**Column roles on a wide table.** `td.r` is the whole vocabulary a five-column table
needs. Past about seven columns the numbers stop being the only thing in the row and
quietly lose the argument — a money column left in proportional body type at the same
size and colour as the free text beside it cannot be compared down the page. Four
classes on `.tbl td` say which cell leads, which anchors, and which recede:

- `.lead-cell` — the row's subject (a buyer's name, a store name). Archivo 600, primary
  text. **One per row**; a second one leaves the row with no entry point again.
- `.money-cell` — pairs with `.r`; the row's headline figure. Primary text at
  `font-weight:500`, not 600 — DM Mono is loaded at 400/500 only (see the font link in
  `index.html`), so a heavier request is synthesised and faux-bold smears the digits it
  is meant to strengthen. Every DM Mono rule in `style.css` uses 500; match it.
- `.date-cell` — reads left-aligned like text but in DM Mono, so a column of dates lines
  up. This is the treatment the consignment and history ledgers already re-type inline
  (`class="mono-num" style="font-size:12px;color:var(--text3)"`) — prefer the class.
- `.text-cell` — free text sitting between the figures. Recedes to `--content-muted` at
  `--text-sm`, and its **inner `<span>`** carries `max-width:26ch` so one long value
  can't squeeze the money column. The cap must live on the span: `max-width` on a `td`
  is unreliable under auto table layout. It wraps rather than truncating — a list of
  what someone bought is data, not a label, so no `text-overflow` here.

Reference: the Discovered Buyers and Curated Mailing List tables on the Customers tab.

**A row of cards that behaves like a table** (`.invoice-card` is the reference — a CSS grid of
label/figure cells rather than a `<table>`): it loses the alignment `.tbl` gets for free from
`th.r`/`td.r`, so put it back explicitly. Four rules:
- **Right-align the money cell and give its track a floor.** `text-align:right` plus
  `minmax(<floor>, 1fr)` on that grid column is what makes every card's figure land on one
  shared edge; without the floor a long total reflows the grid and the edge moves card to card.
  Drop the right-align in the narrow stacked layout, where each cell is full width and a
  right-aligned figure just floats away from the labels above it.
- **One figure leads.** The row exists to answer one question — for an invoice, *how much* — so
  that figure goes two steps up the scale (`--text-lg` against the `--text-base` dates beside it).
  A total at the same size as a due date is the bug, whatever colour it is.
- **Captions go on the Archivo micro-label scale** (`--text-3xs`, uppercase, `--tracking-caps`),
  and the figure inside must reset `letter-spacing` and `text-transform` or it inherits the
  caption's tracking. At body size a caption and its own figure read as one run of text.
- **`--gold-text`, never `--gold`, for a figure you want to sing.** Raw `--gold` is a fill/accent
  colour and does not clear AA as text on a card surface in either theme.

**Repeated rows inside one card** (a legend, a mini ledger, any run of label + % + amount)
align with **column subgrid on the card, not `auto` tracks on each row** — `.ch-legend` /
`.ch-leg-row` is the reference. Each row being its own grid looks identical in a mock-up with
one row in it and falls apart with four: `auto` tracks size to each row's own content, so a
card reading 62% / 8% / 30% steps its percentage and money columns in and out down the card.
The card declares the tracks; every row takes `grid-column: 1 / -1` plus
`grid-template-columns: subgrid`. Two rules come with it:
- **Keep the plain tracks in the base rule and put `subgrid` behind
  `@supports (grid-template-columns: subgrid)`.** An unsupported `subgrid` value is dropped,
  which would leave the row a one-column grid — a worse fallback than today's ragged one.
- **Padding and margin go on *every* row, not just the interactive ones.** Padding on a
  subgrid item insets that item's own tracks, so a hover pill given to the clickable rows
  only pushes exactly those rows out of the shared edges. Give all rows the geometry and let
  the interactive modifier carry nothing but paint.

Empty body row: always `colspan` = the real column count, wrapping `.empty-state` —
`<tr><td colspan="N"><div class="empty-state" style="padding:1rem;">No X yet.</div></td></tr>`.

**Sticky column labels on a long ledger:** add `.sys-sticky-head` to the `.tbl-wrap`
(`system.css`, alongside `.sys-long-list`). The header cells pin just under the app header
instead of scrolling away, so row 200 of a money table is still readable as Qty / Unit price /
Total. Already on Order History, the consignment ledger and the tax ledger.

Two conditions before you add it:
- The table must scroll with the **page**. A wrap that is already its own scroll container
  (an inline `max-height` + `overflow:auto`, or one inside a scrolling modal body) resolves
  `top` against the wrong box and pushes its header down *inside* the panel.
- The header must use the flat `.tbl thead` fill. `.all-consignment-table` paints a gradient
  across the whole `thead`; moving that onto each `th` restarts the gradient per cell, so that
  table stays unsticky until someone reworks the fill.

The offset comes from `--sticky-top`, published by `src/lib/sticky-header.js` — it measures the
real `.app-header` height (which wraps to two rows on a phone and grows with the safe-area
inset) and republishes on resize. It falls back to `0px` everywhere it can't measure, and the
wrap falls back to `overflow:hidden` on engines without `overflow: clip`, so both degrade to
today's plain header rather than to a broken one.

### Several action buttons in a table row — one line, stacked only when it must

Two full-target buttons in an Action cell that are left to `flex-wrap` fold into a stack the
moment the table is squeezed, and every row becomes two tap targets tall — twice the height of
the figures beside it. The buyer table (`#cust-body`) settles it:

- Put the buttons in a `nowrap` flex row and give the cell `width:1%; white-space:nowrap`.
- Make room by tightening the *gutters* between columns (8px a side), never the table's outer
  edges, which keep 16px so the first and last columns still line up with the card.
- Make the wrap a size container (`container: <name> / inline-size`) and, below the width where
  one line no longer fits, switch to `flex-direction:column; align-items:stretch` so the stack
  shares one width and the column keeps a straight right edge.
- Scope both to `min-width: 768px`: on a phone the row is a card and `phone.css` re-grids it.
- The same gutter rule frees width across a whole wide ledger. Order History (`.tbl.hist-ledger`)
  keeps its order numbers and dates `nowrap`, gives the notes a `min-width` so they don't fall to a
  word per line, and lets the one header that sits over a tiny figure ("Stock after") wrap to two
  lines. That is what keeps Approve / ✕ in view at a laptop width without a sideways scroll.

## Metric bands — `.kpi-grid` / `.kpi` / `.kpi.is-lead`

The dashboard's numbers band is the reference for any row of headline figures.
Three rules it now encodes, worth keeping on any other metric row:

- **One tile leads, and it is marked in the markup.** `.kpi.is-lead` gets the figure at
  `var(--text-3xl)` (a clamp, so the step over the 28px body figure survives the ≤480px drop to
  22px), a brighter label, an accent-tinted border and `--elev-3`. Everything else stays neutral.
  Pick the lead by what the *screen* is about, not by which number is biggest — the dashboard leads
  on stock on hand because the inventory bar, the threshold alert and the drift banner below it all
  elaborate that one figure.
- **The book accent marks exactly one tile.** `.tab-panel .kpi::before` used to paint the accent
  hairline across every tile in the band, which is the same as painting it on none; it is now split
  into `.kpi.is-lead::before` (accent gradient) and `.kpi:not(.is-lead)::before` (a plain neutral
  rule). Same for the figure colour: only the lead keeps `.kpi-value.gold`, which
  `.tab-panel .kpi-value.gold` resolves to the live book accent.
- **Tracks are `auto-fit`, never a fixed count, when the tile count varies.** The primary band shows
  four tiles, or five once a book has profit sharing configured. At `repeat(4, …)` that fifth tile
  stranded alone at quarter width on a second line; `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(180px, 1fr))` lets
  whatever a book's setup shows fill one row evenly. Only reach for this where the count really is
  variable — a fixed 3-column grid holding six tiles still beats auto-fit's 5-plus-orphan.

---

## Empty states — `.empty-state`
Two tiers exist; use the richer one whenever the empty state is a primary destination
(a whole tab/panel), and the plain one only for small nested table bodies.

**Plain** (nested table body, low-stakes): `<div class="empty-state" style="padding:1rem;">No sales yet.</div>`

**Rich** (a tab or panel's main empty state) — icon + message + primary CTA, per AGENTS.md
§3 "No Blank States":
```html
<div class="empty-state">
  <div class="e-icon">🏪</div>
  No stores yet. Add your first consignment account.
  <div style="margin-top:12px;">
    <button class="btn gold" onclick="openM('add-store')">+ Add store</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
Real examples: `main.js:8389` (stores), `main.js:8899` (invoices), `main.js:18579` (Stripe
reconciliation). Grep `e-icon` before adding a new empty-state icon convention — most already
carry a single emoji that matches the section's theme (💳 payments, 📄 invoices, 🔍 filtered-empty).

---

## Section heads — `.sec-head`

A screen's sections are headed one of two ways, and mixing the two on one screen is
what `.sec-head` exists to stop. The app has a micro-label tier (`.sect` — 9px uppercase
grey with a trailing hairline) and a heading tier (`.section-hed` — Anton 20px uppercase).
Before this landed, the "All books" landing screen ran two `.sect` labels above a section
that had a gold kicker, a heading and a line of subcopy — so the first screen the publisher
sees carried the faintest headings in the app, and the only part that looked designed was
the supporting section at the bottom.

Use `.sect` for a label *inside* a panel (a sub-divider). Use `.sec-head` for a section that
is one of a screen's top-level parts:

```html
<div class="overview-section">
  <div class="sec-head is-muted">
    <div class="sec-head-titles">
      <div class="sec-kicker"><span class="sec-kicker-dot"></span>Sales Performance</div>
      <div class="section-hed sec-head-title">Combined sales by channel</div>
      <p class="section-subcopy">Where the whole catalogue actually sells.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="sec-head-badges"><span class="pill gold">4 channels</span></div>
  </div>
  …section content…
</div>
```

Four rules it encodes:
- **The heading tier is `.section-hed`, not a new class.** `.sec-head-title` only owns the
  spacing inside the head. A section that invents its own heading size is how a screen ends
  up with three heading tiers.
- **`--sec-accent` tints one head's kicker, and gold is spent once per screen.** Default is
  gold; `.is-muted` re-points it at `var(--slate)`. Reach for the custom property rather
  than a hardcoded colour so it themes itself in both directions. A screen where every
  kicker is gold has no entry point left.
- **`.consignment-summary-head` and friends alias onto these rules** rather than keeping a
  second copy. Extend the selector list; don't fork the declarations.
- **Space between sections has to beat space within one.** `.overview-section` is
  `var(--space-6)`, and it zeroes the trailing margin of the last card inside itself — the
  cards already carry 14–16px of their own, and left alone that sums with the section gap
  and the rhythm drifts down the screen. It is also its own `@container` (`overview-sec`),
  so the head stacks on a narrow panel without a viewport breakpoint.

The pair generalises past the landing screen — the per-book Consignment tab (accounts /
invoices / ledger) is the second screen on it. Two things that surfaced there:

- **`.overview-section` and `.sys-sticky-head` coexist.** `container-type: inline-size`
  applies layout and inline-size containment, not paint containment, so it does **not**
  become a scroll container and a sticky `th` inside it still resolves `top` against the
  page. Verified against the real sheet at `--sticky-top: 60px`.
- **`.sec-head-badges` wraps.** A head's badge slot is not always one pill — these sections
  hang two or three `.btn`s (and a `.sec-head-note` summary line) off it. Without
  `flex-wrap`, `flex-shrink:0` squeezes the title column narrower and narrower until the
  head overflows, well before the 680px container stack takes over. Use `.sec-head-note`
  for a figure or status line riding alongside those buttons — mono and tabular, one step
  below the buttons, so the actions still lead the slot.
- **Replacing `.divider` is the point, not a side effect.** A screen that separates its
  sections with hairlines is one where the spacing is doing no grouping work. Delete the
  rules and let the section gap carry it.

---

## Dialogs — `.modal`
Every dialog is a three-part shell: a pinned `.modal-title` header, a scrolling body, a pinned
`.modal-footer` action row. Both pinned edges carry a `--border-default` hairline and a
`--space-3` gradient scrim. Four rules hold it together — break any one and the shell leaks.

- **The block padding lives on the header and footer, not on `.modal`.** `.modal` sets
  `padding: 0 var(--space-6)` only. A sticky child can pin no higher than the scrollport edge,
  so padding left on `.modal` would sit *above* the pinned header and show a strip of scrolling
  content through the gap. `.modal:not(:has(.modal-title))` and its footer twin give that
  padding back to the two dialogs here that render without one of those parts (the receipt
  lightbox and the invoice paper). Repeat the split in any breakpoint that re-declares
  `.modal`'s padding — the ≤768px block does.
- **A hairline alone is not enough; it needs a scrim.** An opaque pinned bar guillotines
  whatever glyph lands on the seam, and a field label sliced through its x-height reads as a
  rendering fault rather than as "there is more above". The scrim fades the body into the
  pinned surface over one spacing step instead. It is absolutely positioned, which also keeps
  it out of the footer's flex row — a static pseudo-element there lays out as a third button.
- **Offset the scrim past the hairline: `calc(100% + 1px)`.** A percentage offset on an
  absolutely positioned box resolves against the containing block's *padding* box, so a plain
  `100%` starts the scrim inside the border and paints its opaque end straight over the seam
  it is meant to sit below.
- **`.modal-title` must be the dialog's first element.** It is what the header *is*, and what
  the padding guard keys off. A dialog opening with something else pins that something else
  against the top edge. `tests/modal-shell-seams.test.js` holds the two known exceptions in an
  exact allowlist.

Spacing comes from the shared rule — never an inline `margin-top` on a footer. Twelve of them
used to hand-pick 14/16/18px, so no two dialogs put their buttons the same distance below the
last field.

## Stacked panels — group with a stage wrapper, not with margins

A tall panel built as a flat run of blocks, each carrying its own
`margin-bottom`, always drifts: the POS checkout column reached eleven blocks
whose gaps ran 6 / 10 / 8 / 4 / 12 / 12 / 4 / 14 / 12 / 8 / 8 px. However
carefully each one was chosen, the space *between* the stages of the task ended
up the same as the space *inside* them, so nothing grouped and the panel read as
one undifferentiated run of small text.

The fix is two numbers, not eleven. Wrap each stage of the task in a stage div
and let two `gap`s do all the spacing — see `.pos-cart-panel` /
`.pos-checkout-stage` (`style.css`, "POS CHECKOUT PANEL") for the reference:

```css
.some-panel       { display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:var(--space-5); }  /* BETWEEN stages */
.some-panel-stage { display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:var(--space-2); }  /* WITHIN one    */
```

Three rules that come with it:
- **Between must exceed within, visibly.** One step apart (12 vs 8) is not a
  grouping, it's a rounding error. `--space-5` against `--space-2` is.
- **Zero out child margins that predate the gap.** A component written for a
  flow context brings its own `margin-bottom` and it stacks *on top of* the gap
  — `.pos-checkout-stage .pos-oversell-note{margin-bottom:0}` is that fix. A
  `display:none` child (`[hidden]`) contributes no gap, so conditional rows need
  no special handling.
- **`min-width: 0` on the stage.** Without it a long unbreakable figure — a
  mixed-currency total, a full ISBN — stretches the flex item and widens the
  whole column.

Second surface on this pattern: the book dashboard's Inventory and Break-even
panels (`.stock-block` / `.stock-stage`, "STOCK BLOCK" in `style.css`). Same
before-state — five hand-picked margins running 20 / 10 / 17.6 / 9.6 / 12px — and
the same two-gap fix. Two things it adds:

- **The reading goes ABOVE the bar it explains.** A progress bar is an
  illustration of a figure, so the figure has to exist first; with the number
  underneath, the bar is the panel's largest element and the reading is a
  footnote to it. Order is figure → bar → breakdown pills, all inside one stage.
- **Scope a bar's height to the panel, not to `.bar-track`.** 5px of trough
  carries no weight under a 22px figure, but the same class draws the catalogue's
  own bars, which are sized against a whole shelf of cards. `.stock-block
  .bar-track{height:8px}` + `.stock-block .bar-fill{height:100%}` leaves those
  alone.

**Layout that JS resets belongs in a class, not inline.** `#d-recalc-onhand-wrap`
held `display:flex` in its `style` attribute while `updateDashboard()` reset the
row with `style.display = ''` on leaving author mode — which clears the inline
property outright and left the row stacked. Anything a `style.display = ''`
touches must get its display from CSS (`.stock-actions`).

**Money figures lead on type, not just size.** The sale total on that panel was
34px Syne 800 — the old heading face, proportional — so the digits re-widthed on
every quantity tap and it was the one monetary value in the app not in DM Mono.
Any figure that leads a panel gets `'DM Mono'` + `font-variant-numeric:
tabular-nums` + `font-feature-settings:"tnum" 1,"zero" 1` and takes its
prominence from the size step and `--text-3xl`, not from an accent colour.
Reserve the status colours for status: a pending cart total wearing `--green`
claimed the settled/paid role and left the panel with three accents competing
(gold heading, green total, gold primary button) and no emphasis left.

---

## Dropdowns & menus
The book switcher (`index.html:311`, `#book-dropdown-menu`) is the canonical custom dropdown:
absolute-positioned panel, `var(--ink2)` background, `0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,.4)` shadow,
`border-radius:var(--r2)`, items highlighted via `.book-dd-item` active-state color swap
(`main.js` `switchBook()`, ~line 2593). Reuse this shell for any new custom dropdown instead
of a native `<select>` when you need rich items (color dots, icons, secondary text) — for a
plain list of strings, prefer the native `.form-group select` (already themed with the custom
arrow SVG, hover/focus states — `style.css:1592-1597`) over building a custom listbox.

Toggle buttons that hold binary view-state (e.g. "Group by book") should mirror
`.con-group-toggle-btn` (`style.css:2643`): pill-shaped, neutral by default, `.is-on` swaps to
`var(--gold-bg)` background + gold border, and the button always sets `aria-pressed` in JS —
see `toggleConGrouping()` in `main.js`.

---

## Feedback — never `alert()`/`confirm()`
Use `showToast(message, type)` for all non-blocking feedback (`type` omitted = success,
`'warn'`, or `'err'`) — `.toast` (`style.css:1812`) already has color-coded left borders and
slide-up motion. Use `confirmDialog()`/`promptDialog()` (already on `window`, see the
`Object.assign(window, {...})` export block) for anything that would otherwise be a native
`confirm()`. This is a hard rule in AGENTS.md §9 — flag it in review if you see a raw
`alert(`/`confirm(` sneak into a diff.

---

## Every card and notice gets an X — `.card-x`

The owner has asked for this directly: anything that appears on its own (a
notice, a "done" summary, an "up next" card, a checklist, a queue) must have a
close button. Inline form validation and in-modal warnings are the exception —
the modal's own close covers those.

- Use `<button class="card-x" type="button" aria-label="Close …">✕</button>`, placed at
  the top-right of the card. It's a 44px touch target and themed for dark mode.
- Closing must never lose anything. Say where it comes back in the `title`
  ("stays under Reprint a Past Label", "comes back when a new order arrives").
- Removing one item from a list needs a way back ("Show removed" → "Put back").
- A warning about something still broken may close for the visit only, and
  comes back the next time the app opens.

## Loading states
Use `.skeleton-line` (`style.css:2447`) for any content that loads asynchronously (Sheets
sync, Stripe pulls, Gemini OCR) instead of a spinner GIF or a bare "Loading…" string.

## 1. View Transitions — available, but DO NOT wire without asking

The mechanics, for when it *is* wanted: `main.js` performs ~237 `innerHTML` assignments, each
repainting instantly with no continuity. Wrapping one in `document.startViewTransition()` gives
an automatic crossfade; naming elements with `view-transition-name` makes them *morph* rather
than pop. The helper already feature-detects and honours reduced motion, falling back to a
direct synchronous update.

```js
// Helper worth adding once, then reusing everywhere.
// Falls back to a plain call when unsupported or when the user wants reduced motion.
function withViewTransition(update) {
  if (!document.startViewTransition || _prefersReducedMotion()) return update();
  return document.startViewTransition(update);
}
// `_prefersReducedMotion()` already exists in main.js (~line 10974) — reuse it, don't duplicate.

function toggleConGrouping() {
  window._allConGrouped = !window._allConGrouped;
  withViewTransition(() => renderConsignmentTable());
}
```
Support: same-document transitions ship in Chromium and Safari; Firefox is more recent. Because
it is wrapped in a feature check, unsupported browsers simply get today's instant swap.

## 2. Popover API + `<dialog>` — delete the hand-rolled overlay plumbing
`#book-dropdown-menu` (`index.html:311`) currently hand-rolls `position:absolute`,
`z-index:999`, and manual outside-click closing via `closeBookDropdown()`. `.modal`
(`style.css:1714`) likewise hand-rolls its own backdrop and focus handling.

The platform now does all of that natively:
- **`popover`** → top layer (no z-index arms race), light-dismiss on outside click, Esc to
  close, all free. Ideal for the book switcher, the header menu, and any future filter menu.
- **`<dialog>` + `.showModal()`** → focus trap, `::backdrop`, Esc, and inert-background for
  free. Ideal for `openM()` modals and `confirmDialog()`/`promptDialog()`.

```html
<button popovertarget="book-menu">All books</button>
<div id="book-menu" popover>…</div>
```
Pair with `@starting-style` + `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` so they animate in/out from
`display:none` **without JS timers**:
```css
#book-menu {
  opacity: 0; translate: 0 -4px;
  transition: opacity .18s, translate .18s, display .18s allow-discrete;
}
#book-menu:popover-open { opacity: 1; translate: 0 0; }
@starting-style { #book-menu:popover-open { opacity: 0; translate: 0 -4px; } }
```
Migrate opportunistically — when you're already touching a menu or modal, not as a big-bang
refactor.

## 3. `:has()` — state on the parent, without JS class bookkeeping
Currently row/card states are computed in JS and stamped as classes (`is-active`,
`is-settled`, `needs-attention`). `:has()` removes a whole category of that bookkeeping:

```css
/* Row containing an active pill gets the accent bar — no is-active class needed */
.tbl tbody tr:has(.pill.amber) td:first-child { box-shadow: inset 3px 0 0 var(--gold2); }
/* Form group whose input is invalid, styled from the wrapper */
.form-group:has(input:invalid) label { color: var(--red); }
/* Card that ended up empty */
.card:has(.empty-state) { background: var(--cream2); }
```
Prefer `:has()` for *derived visual* state. Keep explicit JS classes when the state carries
domain meaning (a settled account is business state, not a styling artifact).

## 4. Container queries — component-level responsive
All responsiveness today is viewport `@media`. But `.consignment-stat-card`, `.kpi`, and
`.card` render at very different widths depending on their host panel, so viewport width is the
wrong signal. This is the correct fix for "the Sell-through column crowds on mobile":

```css
.consignment-summary-panel { container-type: inline-size; }
@container (max-width: 640px) {
  .consignment-stat-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
  .all-consignment-table th:nth-child(6),
  .all-consignment-table td:nth-child(6) { display: none; } /* Sell-through column */
}
```
Rule going forward: **new components use `@container`; leave existing `@media` blocks alone**
until you're already editing them.

## 5. `content-visibility` — long-list performance with zero dependencies
The no-runtime-deps constraint rules out virtualization libraries, but the platform has a
one-line equivalent. For long ledger/history tables (order history, tax ledger, reconciliation):

```css
.tbl tbody tr { content-visibility: auto; contain-intrinsic-size: auto 44px; }
```
The browser skips rendering off-screen rows entirely. This is the answer to "will this jank at
200+ rows" — reach for it before considering manual windowing.

## 6. Typography & layout polish — one-liners with real payoff
```css
h1, h2, h3, .sect        { text-wrap: balance; }  /* no orphaned last word in headings */
.section-subcopy, p      { text-wrap: pretty; }   /* no single-word final lines */
html                     { scrollbar-gutter: stable; }  /* no layout shift when content grows */
textarea                 { field-sizing: content; }     /* grows with input, no JS autosize */
```

## 7. Optimistic UI as a documented visual vocabulary
This is the state-of-the-art *pattern* that matters most for an offline-first PWA, and it's a
product decision, not just CSS: a queued mutation should render **immediately** in its final
position with a visible "not yet synced" affordance, rather than blocking on the network.

The app already has the sync queue; what it lacks is a consistent visual language for it.
Standardise on:
- **Pending** — `.pill.gray` with a `◌` glyph, row at ~70% opacity
- **Failed / needs retry** — `.pill.red` plus an inline retry `.btn.sm`
- **Conflict** — `.pill.amber` with an explicit "server changed this" reconcile action

Never show a queued write as fully-committed, and never make the user wait on the network to
see their own action land. When adding any new mutation path, decide which of these three states
it can enter and render all of them.

**App-level counterpart — `#sync-chip`.** The three classes above say "this row is queued"; the
chip says "the connection is why". It is fixed bottom-left (`.sync-chip` in `system.css`;
`.toast` owns bottom-right) and painted by `renderSyncChip()` in `main.js` from the pure
`describeSyncStatus()` in [src/lib/sync-status.js](../src/lib/sync-status.js). Two rules it
encodes, worth keeping if you touch it:
- **It only appears when there is something the publisher could not otherwise know** — online
  with an empty queue paints nothing at all. A permanent "all good" badge is noise.
- **Offline is reported the instant it happens**, off the `offline` window event, not at the next
  save attempt. Before this the app read "Live" until something was sold.

Copy for it goes through `describeSyncStatus()`, never inline — a test asserts the visible
strings stay free of "Firestore", "queue" and friends.

## 8. Deliberately *not* adopting yet
- **CSS anchor positioning** (`anchor-name`/`position-anchor`) — genuinely the right model for
  dropdown/tooltip placement, but support is still Chromium-led. Revisit; today the popover +
  existing absolute positioning is the safer pairing.
- **Scroll-driven animations** (`animation-timeline`) — attractive, but this is a dense
  financial tool where scroll-jacking hurts more than it delights. Skip.
- **`oklch()` colour tokens** — worth it only alongside a full palette migration; mixing
  colour spaces piecemeal in `style.css` would make the tokens harder to reason about, not
  easier.

## Decisions on record

Reviewed against live specimens and settled. **These are not open questions.** Each one is a
deliberate choice, and two of them look like bugs if you don't know the history — so confirm
here before "fixing" anything in this list.

| Decision | Ruling | Why it matters |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Shadows** | Keep the two-layer elevation scale. `--shadow`/`--shadow2` stay aliased onto `--elev-2`/`--elev-3`. | Reviewed on real cards and stat tiles. Prefer `--elev-*` directly in new code. |
| **Button height** | `.btn` stays at ~33px. **Overrides AGENTS.md §3's 44px minimum.** | Raising it reflows every screen, and the density is wanted. Do *not* add `min-height` to `.btn`. Apply `.sys-target` to individual controls that genuinely need a full target. |

Button height is a place where the codebase deliberately does *not* match `AGENTS.md`. That is
intentional. If a future change makes it worth reopening, raise it with the user rather than
silently converging on the written guideline. (Dark mode used to be the second such divergence;
the user asked for it and it now ships — the row above records what replaced the old ruling.)

### A token scale can collide with itself once both ends go dark

`--ink`/`--ink2`/`--ink3`/`--ink4` is the "permanently dark chrome" scale (header, tab bar, sync
bar, the book-switcher and header-menu dropdowns, the publisher sidebar menu — all via the
`--surface-inverse-raised` alias onto `--ink2`). In light mode this scale has the whole distance
from near-black up to `--cream`'s `#f7f2e9` to climb through, so every step is obviously distinct
from the page. In dark mode `--cream` itself drops to near-black, and `--ink2` was authored at
`#14110e` — one RGB unit from `--cream`'s `#14110d`. Every panel built on it (the tab bar, both
dropdown menus, the sidebar menu) rendered with no visible fill in dark mode: same colour as the
page underneath, nothing but a shadow and a 4%-opacity hairline. `--ink3`/`--ink4` happened to
escape this because their light-mode step sizes are big enough to land them *above* `--cream` in
dark mode instead — fine for their role as hover/active accents inside the chrome, but not a fix
you can lean on for `--ink2`, which is a flat base fill sitting directly against page content.

The lesson for the next dark-mode token: when a scale's page-relative role flips end for end
(light mode: light page, dark chrome digs down; dark mode: dark page, chrome has to dig down from
an already-near-black start), check each step against the *page* token in that theme, not just
against its neighbours in the same scale. Two tokens can each look internally consistent and still
land on top of each other. `tests/dark-chrome-ink2-separation.test.js` pins the fix.

### Working in a themed codebase
1. **`--cream*` and `--ink*` are surfaces, and both flip.** Text on a permanently dark surface
   (header, KPI banners, toast, sidebar) uses `--on-inverse`; text on a saturated accent fill
   uses `--on-accent`. Never `color:var(--cream)` — `tests/theme.test.js` fails on it.
2. **Reach for a token before a literal.** The accent families (`--emerald`, `--rose`,
   `--orange`, `--violet`, `--slate`) exist so a status colour themes itself. A new hardcoded
   hex is a rule that will be wrong in one of the two themes.
3. **Deliberately light things stay light.** The invoice paper, the email composer preview, and
   the carrier logo plates are documents and artwork, not chrome — the foot of
   `theme-dark.css` lists them and why.
4. **A `--cream` fill is "the page" in dark mode.** In light mode `--cream` sits a step below
   the white `--surface-card`, so a component filled with it (the author's Riso pay box, the
   thank-you slip) reads as newsprint. In dark mode `--cream` *is* the page colour, and the
   same component renders with no fill at all. Give it a `.theme-dark` override onto
   `--surface-card`, and move anything that should rise off it up to `--cream3`.
   `tests/author-pay-box-dark-fill.test.js` pins the pay box case.

## Quick pre-flight before shipping any new list/dropdown/button
1. Did I reuse `.btn`/`.pill`/`.tbl`/`.empty-state`/`.toast` instead of new ad-hoc classes?
2. Does every new interactive element have hover **and** `:focus-visible` states, and a
   touch target ≥ 44px?
3. If it's clickable-but-not-a-`<button>` (a table cell, a progress bar), does it have
   `role="button" tabindex="0"` + `onkeydown` Enter/Space handling?
4. Numbers in mono (`DM Mono`), labels and buttons in Archivo uppercase, names and titles in
   Anton — did I match the existing type split?
5. Active/settled/error states — did I reuse the amber/green/gray/red pill convention instead
   of picking new colors?
6. Empty state: rich (icon+CTA) if it's a panel's primary state, plain if it's a nested list.
7. If I re-rendered a list via `innerHTML`, did I leave it un-transitioned? View Transitions
   are available but intentionally unwired — check §1 before calling `withViewTransition()`.
8. New component with width-dependent layout — did I use `@container` rather than a viewport
   `@media` breakpoint? (§4)
9. New menu or modal — did I reach for `popover`/`<dialog>` before hand-rolling z-index,
   outside-click, and Esc handling? (§2)
10. New mutation path — did I decide how its pending / failed / conflict states render, and is
    it optimistic rather than network-blocking? (§7)
11. New table that can run past a screenful and scrolls with the page — did I add
    `.sys-sticky-head` to its wrap so the column labels survive the scroll?
