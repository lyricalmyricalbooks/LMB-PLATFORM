// Multi-turn Gemini with function calling — the transport behind the
// Intelligence panel.
//
// This is a sibling of _callGeminiForReceipts, not a replacement for it. The
// two ask the same account for different things and the request shapes are
// genuinely incompatible:
//
//   • The receipt reader pins response_mime_type to JSON and hands over one
//     image. THAT REQUEST SHAPE CANNOT CARRY TOOLS — Gemini rejects a request
//     that asks for a fixed JSON mime type and declares functions at the same
//     time, so nothing here may set it. This is the single easiest way to break
//     this file by copying from the other one.
//   • The receipt reader caps thinking to zero, because reading a printed
//     total is not a reasoning task and the thinking was pure latency. Working
//     out a margin across a fair's costs and takings IS one, so this leaves the
//     model's own default alone.
//
// What the two DO share is the account: the model chain, the "this key can't
// reach that model" set and the rate-limit cooldown all live in
// ./gemini-quota.js and are held in common. A 429 raised by a receipt scan
// pauses this panel too, which is the point.
//
// Nothing here is streamed. Nothing in this app streams today, and a tool loop
// has little to stream anyway — most of a turn is spent running local
// functions, not waiting on tokens.
