// Catching website orders that never reached the ledger.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// A website sale reaches this app exactly one way: the Gmail scan. fetchOrders()
// asks Apps Script for Big Cartel confirmation emails inside a `daysBack`
// window, and applyOne() writes what it finds into the book's history. Every
// step of that chain is lossy in a way nobody sees. The email can be filtered
// into another label, deleted, or simply older than the window. When it is, the
// sale does not exist anywhere in the app — no history row, no stock
// deduction, no destination in the shipping portal, nothing for a paid label to
// link to.
//
// Meanwhile the storefront itself has known about the order the whole time. The
// Big Cartel API is already connected and already pulls the full order list,
// with the real order number, the customer, the items and the totals. Until now
// the app only *displayed* that list: syncBigCartelShippingPaid() walked every
// storefront order looking for a matching ledger row, found none for the missing
// ones, and said nothing at all. The evidence was in hand and thrown away.
//
// This module is the comparison that was missing. It reads the storefront's
// orders, works out which ones the ledger has never heard of, and describes them
// well enough that the publisher can add each one with a single click. It also
// finds the damage the old workaround caused — see findRecoveredOrderConflicts.
//
// Pure by design: no DOM, no Firestore, no network, no app state. The rules are
// testable on their own, and the ledger mutation stays in main.js with the rest
// of the ledger.
