/**
 * theme.js — appearance preference: storage, resolution, and application.
 *
 * Three preferences, two rendered themes:
 *
 *   'system' (default) — follow the OS. The <html> element carries NO
 *                        data-theme attribute, so the `prefers-color-scheme`
 *                        media query in src/styles/theme-dark.css decides.
 *   'light' / 'dark'   — explicit. data-theme pins the theme and the media
 *                        query is deliberately written to lose
 *                        (`:root:not([data-theme="light"])`), so a publisher
 *                        who wants the light UI under bright lighting keeps
 *                        it even on a device set to dark.
 *
 * A `.theme-dark` class is mirrored onto <html> alongside the attribute. CSS
 * cannot say "matches [data-theme=dark] OR (no attribute AND OS is dark)" in
 * one selector, and the component corrections in theme-dark.css need exactly
 * that — so JS resolves it once and the class carries the answer.
 *
 * Kept free of DOM lookups by id and of app imports so it is unit-testable and
 * so the pre-paint bootstrap in index.html can inline the same logic.
