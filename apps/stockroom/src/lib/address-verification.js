// Address verification — the pure half of the Shipping tab's destination

//
// Shippo exposes two address-validation surfaces and this app has to speak
// both. The modern one is the v2 operation (`ValidateAddress` in Shippo's MCP
// tool catalogue): a GET against /v2/addresses/validate that answers with a
// graded verdict, a standardized `recommended_address`, a confidence score and
// machine-readable reasons. The legacy one is the v1 POST /addresses/ with
// `validate: true`, which answers only `validation_results.is_valid` plus free
// text — and which is all some older Shippo tokens can reach.
//
// Rather than pick one and hope, the feature calls v2 first and falls back to
// v1, so everything downstream needs a single shape to render. That is what
// normalizeAddressVerification produces. Keeping it here — pure, DOM-free and
// fetch-free — is what makes the verdict logic testable without a Shippo token
// or a browser.
