// Receipt filenames and folders — what a receipt is called once it is filed.
//
// Receipts arrive named by whatever produced them: `IMG_4021.HEIC` from a phone,
// `image.jpg` from an email attachment, `1699887766_scan.pdf` from cloud
// storage. Filed under those names, a folder of receipts is unsearchable and an
// accountant asking for "the Staples receipt from May" has to open them one at a
// time.
//
// So a filed receipt is named from the expense it belongs to — date first, so
// the folder sorts chronologically on its own — and filed under the year and
// category an accountant actually asks in:
//
//   receipts/2026/Office Supplies/2026-05-10_Staples_CAD-24.99.jpg
//
// Everything here is pure string work, kept apart from the file writing so the
// naming rules can be tested without a directory handle. The names must survive
// Windows, macOS and Linux alike, so the reserved set is the union of all three
// plus the Windows device names, and lengths are bounded well under the 255-byte
// limit every common filesystem shares.
