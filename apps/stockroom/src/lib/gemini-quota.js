// Shared Gemini account state — the parts of talking to Google that belong to
// the KEY, not to any one caller.
//
// The receipt scanner owned all of this when it was the only thing in the app
// that called Gemini. It no longer is: the Intelligence panel asks the same
// account, on the same free tier, against the same per-minute limit. Two
// callers each holding their own cooldown is not untidy, it is wrong — the one
// that did not see the 429 retries straight back into the window that produced
// it, and both fail. The same goes for a model this key cannot reach: learned
// once by either caller, it should be known to both, or the other pays a full
// upload to be told so again.
//
// So the cooldown, the model chain and the "this key can't use that" set live
// here, shared, and every caller waits on the same pause.
//
// What deliberately did NOT move: the thinking-budget ladder, the
// single-attempt byte cap and the JSON response-mime handling. Those are about
// the shape of a receipt request, not about the account, and they stay with
// _callGeminiForReceipts.
//
// Names are unchanged from when this lived in src/features/receipts.js —
// including GEMINI_RECEIPT_MODELS, which now backs every caller rather than
// only the scanner. Renaming it would buy nothing and would break the suites
// that pin the free-tier floor by matching this source.
