// Turning an online order into a ready-to-quote parcel.
//
// Picking a web order as the shipping destination used to fill in the address
// and stop there. Everything the parcel actually needs — which book is in the
// box, how many copies, what it is worth to customs — was already known from
// the order and had to be re-entered by hand anyway: open the package preset
// dropdown, find the book, set the quantity, fix the customs value, press
// Calculate. Five interactions to restate what the order already said.
//
// This module reads an order's lines and answers the parcel question directly.
// It is deliberately pure — no DOM, no state, no network — so the rules about
// which book sizes the box, what may be filled in silently, and what a human
// still has to look at are testable on their own. The DOM half lives in
// features/shipping.js and the ledger half in features/bigcartel.js.
//
// The one rule that matters most here is `autoSafe`. bigCartelOrderLines
// returns a `confidence` per line, and 'price' means the storefront itemized
// nothing and the book was deduced by dividing what was paid by a list price.
// That guess picks the wrong book whenever two titles share a price, so it is
// good enough to pre-fill a form a publisher is looking at and NOT good enough
// to deduct stock without being asked. Only 'exact' lines clear that bar.

 *   'partial' at least one line could not be tied to the catalog, or a line was

 * it, for two separate reasons that happen to land on the same orders. A mixed
 * box is not described by either book's saved dimensions, so its weight is the
 * publisher's to confirm; it also cannot be recorded as a sale, because the
 * ledger writes one row per order and deducting a two-title order from one
 * title takes the stock off the wrong book. A price-deduced line fails for a
 * third reason: it is a guess about which book was even sold.
 *
 * Everything short of 'exact' still gets the form filled in — a starting point
 * a publisher can see and correct is better than an empty box — it just never
