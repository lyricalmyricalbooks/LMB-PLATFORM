// Costs the business almost certainly had, and has no record of.
//
// The failure mode this exists for is the one nobody notices: an expense paid
// in cash at a fair, or on a card that never gets reconciled, or simply
// forgotten on the drive home. It never reaches the ledger, so at year end the
// business looks more profitable than it was and pays tax on money it spent.
// Nothing in the app can see that expense — by definition it was never entered.
//
// So this does not look for missing expenses. It looks for ACTIVITY THAT COSTS
// MONEY and asks whether the matching cost is there. That is the one advantage
// this app has over a general accounting package: it does not only know what
// was spent, it knows that four hundred dollars of books were sold at a fair in
// Toronto in June — and a fair with takings and no costs did not happen for
// free. The table was paid for. Somebody drove there.
//
// ── Two rules this file holds to ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. NO TAX ADVICE. Nothing here says a cost is deductible, names a tax rate,
//    or estimates a refund. Deductibility is jurisdiction-specific, changes,
//    and is an accountant's call. Every finding is a statement about the
//    publisher's OWN RECORDS — "you took money here and recorded no costs" —
//    which is checkable and true regardless of which country they file in.
//
// 2. EVERY ESTIMATE COMES FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY. Where a figure is offered it
//    is the median of what they themselves spent on comparable things, never an
//    industry average this file invented. A made-up number in a financial tool
//    is worse than no number, because it will be believed.
