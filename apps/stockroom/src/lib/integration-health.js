// Saying when something that runs on its own has stopped working.
//
// Two checks now run unattended: the storefront order watch and the Shippo
// label watch. The whole value of both rests on their actually running, and
// neither could say when it had stopped — each reached a catch site holding the
// error and threw it away into console.warn. A revoked token or a changed
// password therefore looked exactly like a quiet day, and the first visible
// sign was money missing from the books weeks later.
//
// The hard part is not noticing a failure. It is deciding which failures are
// worth a publisher's attention, because the corner this speaks into now also
// carries new orders and imported labels — and an alarm that cries wolf during
// every tunnel and café wifi would cost the trust those depend on. So the
// restraint here is the feature:
//
//   · Offline says nothing at all. The sync chip already owns that message, and
//     a second amber card about the same fact is noise. This mirrors
//     describeSyncStatus, where offline deliberately outranks failure so a
//     dropped connection never presents as a fault.
//   · An integration with no credentials says nothing. That is switched off,
//     not broken.
//   · A refused credential speaks immediately, because it will not fix itself.
//   · Everything else waits for three consecutive failures — a quarter of an
//     hour at the current interval — because almost every one-off failure is a
//     connection that came back.
//
// Pure: no DOM, no storage, no timers, no network. The caller owns the record
// and the painting; what lives here is the judgement.
