/**
 * sheet-sync.js — how a Google Sheets write describes itself, and what order
 * the rows belong in.
 *
 * Two separate things used to go wrong here, and both were invisible until you
 * looked at the sheet itself.
 *
 * 1. Every write that was not a website order was announced as a
 *    *consignment*. The sync log built its badge with a single ternary —
 *    `type === 'order' ? 'Order' : 'Consignment'` — so a customer-paid postage
 *    row (`type: 'shipping'`), which carries no store, no event and no
 *    quantity, was filed under a store partner and summarised as
 *    "undefined · undefined · ×". A real sale and a consignment movement are
 *    different events against different money, and the log has to say which
 *    one it just wrote.
 *
 * 2. The sheet is appended to in the order writes happen to arrive, which is
 *    not the order the sales happened in. A backdated fair sale entered on
 *    Tuesday lands underneath Monday's website orders, and the restore path
 *    (`restoreBookDataFromSheets`) explicitly assumes the opposite — its own
 *    comment reads "they are in chronological order".
 *
 * Everything here is pure: it reads a sync payload and returns strings or an
 * ordering. It never touches the DOM, the queue, or the network, so the wording
 * the publisher reads and the order the rows land in are both testable without
 * a browser or a spreadsheet.
 */

/**
 * The kinds of row this app writes to the sheet.
 *
 * `ORDER` and `SHIPPING` are two halves of the same website sale — the book,
 * and the postage the customer paid on top of it — but they are separate rows
 * with separate money, so they are separate kinds. `CONSIGNMENT` is stock
 * moving to, selling at, or coming back from a store partner. `CONTROL` and
 * `BATCH` are envelopes rather than records: a sheet-clearing instruction, and
 * a bundle of many rows delivered in one call.
