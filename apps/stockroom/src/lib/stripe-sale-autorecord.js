// Card payments that can become sales without anyone pressing Record.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// A customer paying by scanning a book's payment QR code — at a fair table, or
// from the printed sales tracker — pays through a Stripe link the app itself
// made, tagged with the book it sells. The app has always known which book that
// was, and still waited for the publisher to open the Stripe worklist and
// confirm it. Until she did, stock and revenue were both wrong.
//
// This decides which of those payments can be recorded on their own, and says
// why the others cannot. Pure — no ledger, no network — so the rules can be
// tested directly; main.js does the recording, through the same function the
// worklist's Record button uses.
