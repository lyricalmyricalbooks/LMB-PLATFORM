// Canonical tax-category naming for the expense ledger.
//
// EXPENSE_CATEGORIES (main.js) has always been the list the pickers offer, but
// expenses were not only ever created from a picker: the gratuity auto-expense
// wrote its own literal, the demo seed writes another, and receipts imported
// before a category was renamed keep whatever string they were saved with. The
// result is a breakdown that splits one real bucket across two rows —
// "Marketing" beside "Marketing & Advertising", "Postage" beside "Shipping &
// Postage" — which quietly understates both on a tax return.
//
// Folding happens on read rather than by rewriting stored documents: the same
// ledger is reachable offline from a queued local state, so a migration would
// have to run correctly on every device before the numbers agreed. Normalising
// at the point the ledger is assembled makes every consumer — the category
// panel, the master ledger, both CSV exports — agree immediately, and leaves
// the stored data untouched and reversible.

// Legacy or truncated spellings → the canonical EXPENSE_CATEGORIES entry.
// Keys are compared case-insensitively with surrounding whitespace trimmed.
