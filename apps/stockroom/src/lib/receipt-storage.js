// Receipt storage references — where a receipt's bytes actually live, and how
// to reason about the ones that aren't home yet.
//
// A receipt reference is a string stored on an expense. Two shapes matter:
//
//   local://Book_Title/2026-08-12_receipt.jpg   a file in the connected folder
//   https://…firebasestorage…/…                 a blob in cloud storage
//
// The connected folder is the destination; the cloud is a waiting room. The app
// writes a receipt straight to the folder whenever it can reach one, and falls
// back to the cloud when it can't — no folder picked yet, permission lapsed
// after a browser restart, or a device that simply isn't the publisher's
// machine. Nothing is dropped either way: reclaimCloudReceipts() in main.js
// walks the cloud-held ones back down to the folder once it is reachable, and
// deletes each cloud copy only after its local write has succeeded.
//
// Expenses carry receipts in two historical shapes — a single `receipt` string
// and a `receiptFiles` array — so everything here reads both and writes both.
// Callers never have to know which vintage an expense is.

// NOTE ON THE MODEL CHANGE
// This module used to treat cloud storage as a waiting room that had to be
// drained into the local folder, and counted anything sitting there as a
// "backlog" worth nagging about after two weeks. That was backwards, and the
// nagging was the visible symptom: a receipt held safely in the cloud is not a
// problem to be fixed, and the banner reported the normal, healthy state as a
// 95-day failure.
//
// The cloud is now the permanent home. The local folder is an export target the
// owner fills on demand. So what matters is no longer "how long has this waited"
// but "is every receipt actually reachable" — which is what summarizeReceiptStorage
// reports. The old CLOUD_RECEIPT_REMINDER_DAYS threshold is gone with the model
// that needed it.

// WHY THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF WEB LINK
// Treating every https:// reference as "a receipt sitting in our cloud, waiting
// to be moved" was wrong, and it produced a very confusing failure: 40 Shippo
// shipping labels were counted as a backlog, and every attempt to move them
// failed with `TypeError: Failed to fetch`.
//
// They were never in our storage. They are links to files on Shippo's servers,
// and a browser is not permitted to read another site's files directly — it can
// open them in a tab, but it cannot download the bytes. So no amount of retrying
// could ever have worked, and counting them as a backlog meant the app nagged
// about something it was incapable of doing.
//
// So: a receipt we hold in our own cloud storage can be downloaded, moved and
// deleted. An external link is somebody else's file — viewable, never movable.
