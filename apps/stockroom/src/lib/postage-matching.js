// Matching a paid postage receipt to the website order it shipped.

// that an email address, so lib/shipping-reconciliation.js can match on an
// identifier. Postage bought at a counter has none of that. A Canada Post
// receipt carries a recipient name, a tracking number, a carrier order number
// and a price — and of those, the name is the only thing that also appears on
// the website order. So the name is what this module matches on, with the
// surname carrying most of the weight: first names get shortened ("Danny" for
// "Daniela") and mistyped far more often than surnames do.
//
// Pure: no DOM, no state, no network. Everything here is a function of the
// expense and the orders passed in, which is what makes the tiers testable.
