// Noticing that an order already has a label before buying it another.
//
// A second label for the same parcel is pure loss: the postage is charged the
// moment it is bought, and nothing downstream objects — the order just gets
// its tracking number overwritten and the ledger gains a second postage line.
// It happens through a double-click, a second device whose copy of the order
// has not synced yet, or simply forgetting the order was already done.
//
// Pure — takes the order history and the expense ledger as inputs, returns
// what it found, and leaves the wording of the warning to the caller.
