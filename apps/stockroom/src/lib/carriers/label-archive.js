// Keeping every label the publisher has bought, not just the last one.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// A purchased label lives at a Canada Post artifact URL that needs credentials
// and a working connection to fetch. The app also holds the details of the last
// purchase so it can redraw that label as vector art with no network at all —
// but only the last one. Buy a second label and the first becomes unreachable
// the moment Canada Post is unreachable.
//
// That is the wrong way round for how the parcels actually get out. Labels are
// bought in a batch and printed in a batch, and a printer jam, a browser
// restart or a dropped connection between the two lands squarely in the gap.
// The postage is already paid; the label should not need the internet to come
// back.
//
// So each purchase is kept here — the shipment details, not the rendered file,
// because the details are what the vector generator needs and they are a
// fraction of the size of a PDF. Any past label can then be redrawn on demand
// while offline.
//
// Pure and storage-free so the retention rules can be tested directly; the
// localStorage read and write live in canadapost.js.
