/**
 * Reading what Canada Post said went wrong — once, in one place.
 *
 * Every REST 4.0.0 failure comes back as `{"messages":[{"code","description"}]}`,
 * often with more than one message, and the code inside it is the only thing
 * that says which of six very different problems this is. Answering that
 * question at each call site is how a missing payment method on the account
 * ends up being retried nine times and then reported to the publisher as
 * "shipping is down": the status alone cannot tell those apart, and the
 * description alone is written for a developer.
 *
 * So two questions are answered here and kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *   WHAT WENT WRONG comes from the message code, which is the more specific of
 *   the two signals — a service code returned under a plain bad-request status
 *   is still a service problem.
 *
 *   WHETHER TO CALL AGAIN comes from the HTTP status, which is the only thing
 *   that says whether repeating the call is safe. That matters most for label
 *   creation: an unrecognised answer is treated as "do not repeat", because a
 *   second attempt at a shipment that may already have succeeded buys a second
 *   label with real postage on it.
 *
 * The one place those two cross is a missing payment method — see
 * CANADAPOST_PAYMENT_METHOD_CODES, which is documented as both.
 *
 * Owner-facing wording lives here too, in `summary`: one plain sentence with no
 * codes and no jargon in it, because this is what ends up on the screen the
 * publisher is looking at when a parcel will not print. The raw description is
 * kept beside it in `detail` rather than folded into that sentence, so the
 * exact words Canada Post used are never lost but never dumped on the owner
 * mid-sentence either.
