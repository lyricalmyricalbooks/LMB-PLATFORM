// Noticing a label that was bought somewhere else.
//
// A label bought inside this app is already done by the time the purchase
// returns: buyShippoLabel writes the expense and reconciles it against the
// order in the same breath. A label bought on Shippo's own website is invisible
// here until somebody goes and fetches it — four clicks into the Tax Centre,
// then two more per label in the reconciliation worklist, and no prompt
// anywhere that there is something to fetch in the first place.
//
// That gap is not cosmetic. The shipping P&L, the carrier scorecard and each
// order's own shipping summary all read TAX_CENTER.businessExpenses, so postage
// that has not been imported is money missing from the books, and postage
// imported but not linked is money with no order behind it.
//
// This module is the decision half of closing that gap: when another check is
// worth making, which rows in the answer are not already in the ledger, and
// what to say about them. Pure — no DOM, no timers, no network — deliberately
// mirroring lib/order-watch.js so "the app checks something on its own" is one
// idea in this codebase rather than two.
//
// The cost insight that makes polling viable at all: Shippo returns
// transactions newest-first, and the ledger's own `shippo:<id>` refs are
// already the authoritative dedupe surface. So a check reads page one and stops
// the moment every row on it is known — one request, in the steady state.
