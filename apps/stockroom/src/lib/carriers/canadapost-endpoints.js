/**
 * Canada Post API endpoint registry.
 *
 * Every Canada Post path the app calls is declared here, in one place, so that
 * a path can never again be half-migrated: the rating call was moved to the
 * Developer Portal gateway while the shipment call was left on the retired
 * `/rs/{customer}/ncshipment` shape, pointed at a host that has no such path.
 * That mismatch is invisible when each endpoint is a string built inline at its
 * call site, and it is what stopped a sandbox run from ever reaching a real
 * Canada Post label.
 *
 * Standing rules for this file — see docs/canada-post-shipping-api.md:
 * NEVER invent a path, media type or scope here. Every value must come from the
 * portal's guides or the downloaded OpenAPI spec for the API in question. An
 * unconfigured value is reported as unconfigured; it is never guessed at,
 * because a guessed path fails at the counter, not in the console.
 */

 * credentials, check the casing of this string against the base URL shown on
 * your own app's page before assuming the path below is wrong.
