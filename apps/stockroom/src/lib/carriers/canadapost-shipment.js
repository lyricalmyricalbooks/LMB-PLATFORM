/**
 * Canada Post Shipping API 8.0.0 — reading what Create Shipment gives back.
 *
 * Split out of canadapost.js because these are pure functions over a response
 * body, and the shipment path is the one place in this app where being wrong
 * costs real money: a mis-read response can mark an order shipped against a
 * label that was never created, or leave a created label untransmitted and earn
 * a surcharge weeks later.
 *
 * See docs/canada-post-shipping-api.md for the standing rules. The short
 * version: paths and workflow are documented and fixed; the exact field names
 * in the request body and response envelope are only in the app's OpenAPI spec,
 * so everything here reads defensively across the shapes Canada Post has used
 * rather than asserting one and throwing on the rest.

 * FLAT — `shipmentId`, `shipmentStatus`, `trackingPin`, `links` at the top
 * level, no wrapper at all. The wrapper names below are kept for the legacy
 * shapes, because a shipment created before this change and reprinted after it
 * still has to be readable.
