/**
 * recurring.js — the schedule maths behind Tax Centre → Recurring Subscriptions.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: no DOM, no TAX_CENTER, no Firestore. The Tax Centre
 * feature module owns the rendering and the writes; this module owns the
 * question "which charges has this subscription incurred, and when is the next
 * one?" — which is the part that has to be right, works offline, and is worth
 * testing directly.
 *
 * Why a module at all: the injector used to live inline in
 * processRecurringExpenses() as a month-walking `while` loop that assumed every
 * subscription bills monthly, forever, starting on `new Date(startDate)`. Three
 * problems came out of that shape:
 *
 *   1. `new Date('2026-01-05')` parses as UTC midnight, so `.getDate()` in any
 *      negative-offset timezone (this app's users are in Canada) reports the
 *      4th. Every injected charge silently landed a day early. Dates here are
 *      parsed field-by-field instead, so a 'YYYY-MM-DD' string means the same
 *      calendar day everywhere.
 *   2. A yearly subscription had to be entered as 1/12th of its price to total
 *      correctly, which then logged twelve wrong-looking expenses a year.
 *   3. There was no way to stop one short of deleting it, and deleting it threw
 *      away the record of what had already been injected.
 *
 * Cadence, an end date, and a paused flag all now live on the record; the ledger
 * behaviour for an existing monthly subscription with none of those fields set
 * is unchanged apart from the timezone fix.
 *
 * `rateChanges` is the fourth field, and the reason is the same shape of
 * problem: a standing cost's price moves (rent goes up in September, a plan
 * re-prices at renewal), and the only way to record that was to overwrite
 * `amount`. That is wrong in both directions — a backfill after the edit posts
 * old periods at the new price, and the record loses any memory of what the
 * cost used to be. A subscription now carries `amount` as the price it started
 * at plus a dated list of adjustments, and every charge is priced by the date it
 * falls on, so history stays exactly as it was billed and a rise can be entered
 * before it takes effect.
 *
 * A change can carry `movesCharge`, which re-anchors the billing day to its own
 * date from that point on — the rent that goes up *and* moves from the 1st to
 * the 5th in the same letter. The walker never bills one period twice when a
 * day moves earlier; see walkCharges.
