// Whether the words in an expense's description support the category it is
// filed under — judged only against the business's OWN past filing habits,
// never a category vocabulary this file invented.
//
// This deliberately stops short of being a classifier. It never decides what
// category a description "should" be — a description is free text, and a
// model guessing at its right home from outside knowledge is exactly the
// failure mode publisher-intel-tools.js's findAnomalies already refuses to be
// for this same ledger: "a language model guessing at which expenses look
// miscategorised is exactly the failure mode this design is trying to avoid
// in a financial ledger."
//
// What this checks instead is narrower and provable: "you have filed the
// word 'ink' under Printing & Production four separate times, and this once
// under Travel, where 'ink' has never appeared before" is a fact
// about THIS ledger, not a guess about what the word means. Every finding
// names the exact words behind it and how many times the business itself
// used them under each category, so it is checkable and wrong only if the
// count is wrong.
