// The corner where the app says something happened while nobody was looking.
//
// The storefront watch got here first and put one card, fixed, in the top-right
// — the only corner not already taken, with the toast at bottom-right and the
// sync chip at bottom-left. The label watch needs to say something of the same
// kind, and a second card pinned to the same corner would simply have sat on
// top of the first: two pieces of news, one of them invisible.
//
// So the corner is a region rather than a card, and this is the stack inside
// it. Entries are keyed, because these come from repeating background checks:
// a second check finding two more labels should update what the card says, not
// leave two cards disagreeing about the same subject.
//
// Lives beside modal.js rather than in a feature, because two features need it
// and neither should have to import the other to say something.
