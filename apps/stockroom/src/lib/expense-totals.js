// Pure totals for the expense ledger's footer.
//
// The footer used to add every unreimbursed expense into a single number and
// print it in the BOOK's currency. Two things went wrong with that. A book
// priced in EUR with receipts logged in CAD showed a euro sign over a figure
// that was never euros, and a ledger holding both CAD and USD receipts showed
// their raw sum — a number that is wrong in both currencies. The expense form
// offers six currencies and defaults to CAD regardless of what the book is
// priced in, so a mixed ledger is the normal case here, not the edge one.
//
// Same shape and same rule as `consignmentLedgerTotals()` in lib/consignment.js:
// bucket each row by the currency it was actually recorded in and total each
// bucket on its own. Nothing is converted here on purpose — an exchange rate
// belongs to the day the money moved, and inventing one at render time would
// make the footer disagree with the per-row "Amount (CAD)" column beside it,
// which reads the rate stamped on each expense.

/**
 * Split an expense ledger into one running total per currency.
 *
 * Reports, never recomputes: it reads the amount already stored on each row and
 * files it under that row's own currency code. Two kinds of row are left out
 * entirely, matching what the "Outstanding" figure has always excluded:
 *
 * - **Gratuity copies** — the publisher's own cost for gifted copies. Never
 *   reimbursed to anyone, so they belong to no reimbursement total.
 * - **Author submissions awaiting approval** (`pendingAuth`) — not in the
 *   ledger yet, so counting them would promise money against a row the
 *   publisher has not accepted.
 *
 * @param {Array<object>} expenses  Ledger rows, newest-first or any order.
 * @param {string} bookCode         Currency to file rows that never stamped one.
 * @returns {Array<{code:string, outstanding:number, outstandingCount:number,
 *                  settled:number, settledCount:number}>}
 *          The book's own currency first, then the rest alphabetically, so the
 *          footer's row order is stable across re-renders.
