// Following a parcel after the label is bought.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// Once a label was bought the app stopped caring about the parcel. It knew the
// tracking number, and it already knew how to ask Canada Post about one (the
// tracking-number audit does exactly that), but nobody asked unless they went
// looking. So a parcel sitting at a post office waiting for pickup, or on its
// way back to the shop, was found out the slow way: a customer email three
// weeks later, by which time a claim is harder and the customer is annoyed.
//
// This module decides which shipped orders are worth asking about, how to read
// Canada Post's answer, and what to tell the publisher. Pure — no network, no
// DOM, no ledger — so the rules can be tested directly. shipping.js asks.
