// half that touches the world: it keeps the record in browser storage, raises
// the card, and sets the mark that stays on the tab after the card is
// dismissed.
//
// It sits in lib rather than in either feature because both the storefront
// watch and the label watch need it, and neither should have to import the
// other to say that it is not working.
