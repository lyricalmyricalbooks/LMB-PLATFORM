// Finding the labels a carrier emailed about.
//
// The Canada Post sweep covers labels bought on that account. It cannot cover
// the rest: another courier's website, or a Canada Post purchase made outside
// the API customer number. What those do leave is an email — a shipment
// confirmation with a tracking number, a total and usually the label attached.
//
// The app already has the whole pipeline for this. It searches Gmail, fetches
// bodies in batches, downloads attachments and reads receipts with AI, all for
// the receipt scanner. The search takes a client-supplied query, which is the
// happy accident that makes this cheap: pointing it at carrier mail needs no
// Apps Script change, no script version bump, and nothing for the publisher to
// redeploy.
//
// What this module adds is the two things that pipeline does not know: which
// emails are shipping, and how to read one.
//
// READING IS DETERMINISTIC FIRST, AI SECOND. A carrier confirmation is not
// free prose — it contains a tracking number in a shape `carrierFromTracking`
// can verify, and a total in a shape a regex can find. Trying those first means
// most emails cost nothing to read, return the same answer every time, and
// cannot hallucinate a figure into somebody's tax records. The AI parse already
// in receipts.js remains the fallback for the ones this cannot crack.
//
// Pure — no DOM, no network.
