// ── CHASING A LATE INVOICE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An invoice goes out and then goes quiet. The app already knows when one is
// past its due date — the to-do rail says so — but knowing it never moved any
// money, because the follow-up email is the awkward thing nobody writes.
//
// This module holds every judgement about that follow-up: whether an invoice is
// owed one, what it should say, and when it is a decent hour to send it. It is
// DOM-free and Firestore-free so all of it can be tested directly, and so the
// sweep in main.js is left doing nothing but the sending.
//
// Two rules shape the whole thing, because the output is real email to real
// customers rather than a number on a screen:
//
//  1. ONE automatic reminder per invoice, ever. A person who is chased twice by
//     a machine for the same bill remembers the publisher for the wrong reason.
//     Sending another is a deliberate act, and stays a button.
//  2. A reason is always returned for NOT sending. The sweep, the "Remind now"
//     button and the count shown when the feature is switched on all ask the
//     same function, so what the owner is told matches what actually happens.
