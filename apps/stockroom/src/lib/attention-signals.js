// ── WHAT NEEDS THE PUBLISHER'S ATTENTION ───────────────────────────────────
//
// One engine, two screens. The notifications rail on the landing page shows the
// urgent slice of what this returns; the To-do tab shows all of it, grouped.
// They are deliberately not two separate scans: built twice they would drift,
// and a shop owner reading "2 things need you" beside a to-do list holding four
// would stop trusting either.
//
// Everything here is DERIVED. Nothing is stored, nothing is dismissed, nothing
// is marked read. A signal exists exactly as long as the thing it describes is
// true, so restocking a book is what clears its low-stock warning — there is no
// second state to get out of step with the first, and nothing new to sync. That
// is also why this can run on every render without touching Firestore.
//
// The module is pure and takes everything it needs as arguments. Conditions the
// app already computes elsewhere against live connections (sync health,
// integration health, the deployed Apps Script version, pending author
// submissions) are passed IN as plain data rather than recomputed here, so this
// file never reaches for a global and stays trivially testable.
//
// One rule worth stating because it is easy to get backwards: only flag a gap
// that is genuinely detectable. `listPrice` and `threshold` silently default to
// 40 and 10 when left blank, so a never-entered value is indistinguishable from
// a deliberate one — flagging those would nag about books that are perfectly
// fine, which is how a to-do list teaches people to ignore it.
