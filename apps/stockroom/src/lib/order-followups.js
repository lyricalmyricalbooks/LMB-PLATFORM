// Two things worth hearing about a website order after it is recorded.
//
// 1. It was paid for and nothing has been sent. Orders now reach the ledger on
//    their own, which means one that arrives in a busy week can be recorded,
//    counted and then forgotten — until the customer writes to ask.
// 2. Its postage cost more than the customer paid for shipping. A few dollars
//    lost per parcel is invisible order by order and obvious over a month,
//    and the fix — adjusting the store's shipping rates — is easy once seen.
//
// Pure: the caller passes ledger rows and the postage already matched to them.
