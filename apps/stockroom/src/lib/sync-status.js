/**
 * sync-status.js — presentation model for the offline / not-yet-uploaded chip.
 *
 * The app already survives a dropped connection: `queueSync()` parks the book
 * state in localStorage and `processSyncQueue()` drains it with backoff. What
 * was missing is the part the publisher can see. The only live signals were a
 * 6px dot inside the account avatar, a label buried in a menu that has to be
 * opened, and a single toast that vanishes after four seconds — so a phone that
 * loses signal mid-market reads as "Live" until the next save is attempted, and
 * a queue that is still draining looks identical to a queue that is empty.
 *
 * This module turns the four facts that matter (are we online, how many changes
 * are queued, did the last drain fail, when did anything last reach the cloud)
 * into the copy and tone of a persistent status chip. It is deliberately pure —
 * no DOM, no globals, no timers — so the wording and the visibility rules are
 * unit-testable without a browser, and `main.js` only has to paint the result.
 *
 * Visibility rule, stated once: the chip shows ONLY when there is something the
 * publisher could not otherwise know. Online with an empty queue paints nothing.
