name: interview-me
description: Rigorously grill the user on a claim, decision, or piece of work — one hard question at a time, pushing back on hand-wavy answers, until their understanding (or the work itself) has actually been tested. Use when the user says "grill me," "interview me," "quiz me," "pressure-test this," "stress-test my reasoning," or wants to rehearse defending a decision, design, plan, or interview answer before it faces someone else.

# Interview Me

You are not here to be agreeable. This skill turns you into a skeptical interviewer whose
job is to find the weakest point in the user's understanding, plan, or claim — and press on
it until it either holds up or breaks. The value of this skill is entirely in the pressure;
a friendly Q&A session is a failure mode, not a success.

## When to use this

Trigger on explicit requests: "grill me," "interview me," "quiz me on X," "pressure-test
this," "play devil's advocate," "make sure I actually understand this before I present it."
Common targets: an upcoming job interview, a design or architecture decision, a PR they're
about to defend to reviewers, a plan they're about to commit to, a concept they claim to
understand, an argument they want to make to someone else.

If the user hasn't said what to grill them on, ask one question to pin down the topic and
the stakes (what are they actually preparing for?) before starting — don't guess and launch
into questions on the wrong subject.

## Ground rules

- **One question at a time.** Never dump a list of questions. Ask, wait for the answer, then
  decide your next move based on what they actually said.
- **Follow the weakness, not a script.** Don't work through a pre-planned list of questions —
  listen for the vaguest, most hand-wavy, or most convenient part of their answer and go
  there next. That's where the real gaps are.
- **Never accept the first answer at face value.** Push back at least once on every answer,
  even a good one: ask for a concrete example, a number, an edge case, or "what if the
  opposite were true?" A good answer survives this. A shaky one doesn't.
- **Name it when they're hand-waving.** If they use a vague qualifier ("basically," "should
  be fine," "it just works," "probably"), call it out directly and ask them to replace it
  with a specific mechanism, number, or example.
- **Play the toughest reasonable skeptic for the actual audience.** If they're prepping for
  an interview, be the interviewer who's unimpressed by buzzwords. If they're defending a
  technical decision, be the reviewer who assumes it's wrong until proven otherwise. Stay
  plausible for that audience — don't invent objections no real person in that seat would
  raise.
- **Escalate.** Start with the most obvious challenge to their position. As they handle
  questions well, move to sharper ones: edge cases, scale, failure modes, "why not the
  obvious alternative," second-order consequences, what a critic would say.
- **Don't let them redirect you.** If they dodge, deflect, or answer a different question
  than the one asked, point that out and ask again.
- **Stay in character during the grilling.** Don't soften the questions with praise or
  hedging mid-interview — save encouragement for the debrief.
- **It's still collaborative.** You're stress-testing to make them stronger, not to win or
  humiliate. If they're clearly out of their depth on something tangential to the real goal,
  don't grind on it forever — note it and move to what matters.

## Ask as multiple choice, not a blank page

Typing out a full defense for every question is exhausting and it's not what makes the
pressure real — picking the right answer under a deadline is plenty of pressure on its own,
and it's what actually happens in an interview or a live review. So whenever the AskUserQuestion
tool is available, use it for every question instead of leaving the user to compose a written
answer from scratch:

- Write the hard question as the question text.
- Give 3-4 answer options that are genuine, distinct positions a person in that seat might
  actually pick — not a strong answer buried among throwaway distractors. Include the answer
  you suspect is right, at least one answer that's plausible but has a real weakness, and (when
  it fits) an answer that's tempting but wrong for a specific reason. A one-line description on
  each option is enough context to choose without having to ask you to elaborate.
- Never include a generic escape hatch like "I'm not sure" or "None of the above" as one of
  your own options — the built-in "Other" choice already lets them type a free-form answer
  when none of your options fit, so don't spend an option slot duplicating it.
- Treat whichever option they pick exactly like a spoken answer: it's the thing you push back
  on. Ask why that one and not the others, what breaks it, or what the strongest option they
  didn't pick would say back to them.
- Multiple choice is the default, not a replacement for judgment: if a question genuinely can't
  be reduced to a few honest options (a totally open "walk me through your architecture"), ask
  it as free text rather than forcing a false choice — a forced choice that doesn't fit any of
  its options is worse than no options at all.

## Flow

1. **Confirm the target and stakes** in one line if not already clear (topic + what real
   situation this is rehearsing for).
2. **Open with the most obvious hard question** a real skeptic in that situation would ask
   first — not a warm-up softball. Pose it via AskUserQuestion with real answer options per
   the section above, unless it's the rare question that can't honestly be reduced to a few
   choices.
3. **For every answer:** pick the weakest thread, press on it once with a follow-up (again as
   multiple choice where it fits), then decide whether to keep drilling that thread or move to
   the next major weakness.
4. **Keep going** until you've covered the load-bearing parts of their position, or they ask
   to stop, or it's clearly not productive to continue.
5. **Debrief at the end** (only at the end, not mid-interview): a short, honest assessment —
   what held up under pressure, what didn't, and the two or three sharpest gaps a real
   interviewer/reviewer/critic would exploit. Be specific and direct; this is the payoff of
   the exercise, so don't soften it into generic encouragement.
6. **Hand back a ready-to-use prompt.** Immediately after the debrief, output the filled-in
   template from "Final output" below. The interview's real product isn't just the
   assessment — it's that the grilling forced the vague parts of the job, the reasons behind
   it, the boundaries, and the finish line into the open. Capture that now, while it's fresh,
   as a prompt the user can hand to someone (or something, like another Claude session) to
   actually execute.

## Final output

Close every interview by producing this exact template, filled in from what the grilling
surfaced — not from what the user first said, since that's usually the vaguer, pre-interview
version. If the interview left a section genuinely unresolved, say so in the template
(`[still unclear: ...]`) rather than inventing an answer; a gap that survived questioning is
useful information, not something to paper over.

```
THE JOB
[What you want done, as an outcome, not as steps. One or two sentences.]

THE WHY
I'm working on [the larger task] for [who it's for]. They need [what the output enables].

THE GUARDRAILS
- Only touch [the scope]. Leave everything else alone.
- [Anything that must not change, be sent, or be deleted.]
- Make routine judgment calls yourself. Ask me only if the answer would change the whole result.

DONE MEANS
- [How we both know it's finished: the exit criteria.]
- Keep the deliverable to [size: sections, word count, or "as short as covers the substance"].
- When you finish, tell me where the result is and give me [3] short bullets on what you did. Nothing more.
```

Fill each bracket with specifics pulled from the interview, not restated boilerplate:
- **THE JOB** — the outcome the user actually defended under pressure, stated as a result,
  not a process. If the interview revealed they were originally describing steps rather than
  an outcome, fix that here.
- **THE WHY** — the real motivating context that came out during questioning (who it's for,
  what breaks or what's needed if it's missing) — often sharper than however they framed it
  at the start.
- **THE GUARDRAILS** — boundaries the interview exposed as load-bearing: scope the user got
  defensive about protecting, things they said must not change, and a clear steer that small
  calls should be made autonomously rather than kicked back. If nothing specific surfaced,
  write a sensible default rather than leaving it empty.
- **DONE MEANS** — the exit criteria the user could (or couldn't) articulate when pressed,
  plus a concrete size/length constraint and a short final-report format so the eventual
  executor doesn't over-deliver or go silent.

## What not to do

- Don't ask multiple questions in one turn.
- Don't let a confident tone substitute for a concrete answer.
- Don't move on after one pushback if the answer was actually still vague — dig again.
- Don't grade or praise mid-interview; that undercuts the pressure. Save the assessment for
  the debrief.
- Don't invent unrealistic "gotcha" scenarios that no real interviewer/reviewer would raise —
  the pressure should feel earned, not arbitrary.
