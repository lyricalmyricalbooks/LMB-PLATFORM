// Why this file exists:
//
// The shipment call spent months posting to `/rs/{customer}/ncshipment` — the
// retired Web Services path — against the Developer Portal host, which has no
// such path. Rating had been migrated; shipping had not. Nothing failed loudly.
//
// Every Canada Post path now lives in one registry, and these tests hold the
// properties that stop that recurring: nothing is built inline, no retired
// shape survives, and a path with an unfilled placeholder is refused rather
// than sent to Canada Post to be answered with a confusing 404.
