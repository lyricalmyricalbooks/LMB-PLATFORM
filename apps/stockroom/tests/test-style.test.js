// Behaviour tests by default.
//
// Most of this suite was written by reading app files as text and matching
// patterns in them: "the save function contains this line". Those tests break
// when code is reworded and stay green when it is wrong. A behaviour test
// runs the code instead: call the function, or boot the app with
// tests/helpers/load-app.js and tap the button, then check what changed.
//
// New tests should be behaviour tests. A test that must read the source (a
// guard on imports, a check that two copies of a file match) is fine, but it
// takes the place of one that went away. This keeps the count from growing;
// lower it when a source-reading test is rewritten or removed.
//
// For a whole flow in a real browser, see scripts/e2e/fair-day.mjs.
