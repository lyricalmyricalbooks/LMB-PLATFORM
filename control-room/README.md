# Control room

The platform's own admin (code plan 2.8). Platform admins only: a confirmed email on `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS`
(comma-separated). The list is empty unless it is set, so nobody is an admin by accident.

## The page (`index.html`, `app.js`)

Plain HTML and browser JavaScript, like the sign-up page; sign in with Google.

- **Every shop** with its plan, release version, status, billing, last release check and health. Shops with a problem
  come first.
- **Health** (`shopHealth`):
  - **Problem**: the last release check failed, a live shop has no saved profile, or something is in the repair queue.
  - **Look**: not live yet, the plan is paused or ended, or the test shop was never checked.
  - **OK**: none of these.
- **Act as this shop**: a 30-minute support sign-in to the shop's admin. It asks why first.
  - Who, why and until when go in the registry and in the shop's own audit log before the sign-in is made.
  - If the log can't be written, there is no sign-in.
- **Switches** (`setup/steps.js` `SWITCHES`): a box for each. It asks why, then changes the switch the same way as the
  command below.

## The command line (`switch.js`)

```bash
CONTROL_ROOM_BY=you@yourpress.example RELEASE_BUILD_ROOT=/var/lmb/builds \
node control-room/switch.js <shop id> <switch> on|off "<why>"
```

The command and the page's switch boxes both run `setSwitch`. It does four things:

1. Updates the shop's saved profile in the registry. Everything else in the profile is kept.
2. Writes the shop's `/shop-profile.js`.
3. Logs who, from, to and why in the registry and the shop's audit log.
4. Deploys the shop's pages again at the release they're already on, so the new profile is live. That release is
   built first if it isn't on hand.

Running it twice is safe: the second run changes nothing and is logged too. It refuses an unknown switch, a missing
on/off or a reason under 10 characters. With no real clients it refuses, so nothing pretends to have changed a shop.

## The server (`controlRoom.js`, `routes.js`)

`createControlRoom({ registry, auditLog, profileFiles, publish, shopAccess, repairs, admins })`, added to the
platform's one web door with `routes: controlRoutes(room)`:

| Route | What |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/control/shops` | every shop, its health and switches |
| `POST /api/control/act-as` | `{ shopId, reason }` -> `{ url, expiresAt }` |
| `POST /api/control/switch` | `{ shopId, name, on, reason }` |

## The support sign-in (`supportAccess.js`)

`supportAccess({ identity, registry, serviceAccount })` is the real `shopAccess`. It makes a custom sign-in token in the
shop's project for the support account `colophon-support`, carrying `support: { by, reason, until }` (an hour at
most). Then it opens `<site>/admin/#support=<token>`. The platform's service account signs the token through IAM
(`clients/identity.js`); there is no key file.

The shop copy does the rest (`apps/shop/functions/CLAUDE.md` › Platform support visits):

- it treats the visit as **staff**, never owner, until `until`;
- its rules check the same time;
- the admin takes the token out of the address and shows a banner with who, why and until when;
- it signs out at the end.

## Not yet

- **The repair queue** (`repairs.open`, plan 2.11).
- **Hosting** the page and the `/api` function.
- **Permissions:** the platform's service account needs permission to manage each shop's users. It already has it as
  owner of the projects it makes.
